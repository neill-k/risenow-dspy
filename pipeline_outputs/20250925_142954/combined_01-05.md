## Evaluation Approach

- **Mandatory/Pass-Fail:** All minimum qualification and compliance items must be met.
- **Technical Scoring:** Weighted scoring for operational, safety, fleet, electrification, technology, workforce, sustainability, and references (per Kean, Fairmont structures; typically ≥70% technical).
- **Price Scoring:** Transparent, standardized cost templates; evaluated separately from technical.
- **References & Past Performance:** Qualitative and quantitative review.
- **Best Value Selection:** Highest total score, with discretion for interviews, clarifications, or site visits.
