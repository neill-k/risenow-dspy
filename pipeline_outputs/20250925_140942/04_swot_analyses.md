## Executive Summary

The U.S. janitorial supplies market is large (estimated $65B+ in 2023, projected $94B by 2030, 5.4% CAGR\[^1^]) and increasingly competitive, with growth driven by hygiene/sanitation, sustainability, digital procurement, and institutional demand. The landscape features national scale consolidators (Imperial Dade, Bunzl), global manufacturers (Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark, Diversey), digital disruptors (WebstaurantStore), and entrenched regional or specialty players (Hillyard, Janitors Supply, Chemcraft, Monarch Brands). Key differentiators include scale, service/consultancy, digital integration, private label, recurring programs, and sustainability credentials. Competitive threats come from commoditization, margin compression, supply chain and labor volatility, digital marketplaces (Amazon Business), and shifting procurement expectations.
