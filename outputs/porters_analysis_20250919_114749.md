# Porter's 5 Forces Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-09-19 11:47:49

## Analysis Parameters
- **Category:** General Industrial Supplies
- **Region:** United States

## Executive Summary

The U.S. General Industrial Supplies market (MRO/industrial distribution) is large and structurally important, led by scale incumbents (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC) who combine dense local networks, extensive assortments, and increasingly powerful digital and managed‑inventory services. Overall threat levels are mixed: new digital entrants lower some barriers, but the cost of achieving nationwide/local rapid fulfillment, technical sales and integrated services keeps true parity with incumbents difficult. Suppliers exert medium power; buyers are increasingly powerful where national account consolidation and eProcurement exist, but sticky managed‑inventory relationships raise switching costs for many customers. Competitive rivalry is high and will remain intense as incumbents pursue omni‑channel service, automation and M&A. Industry attractiveness is moderate — steady demand and digital tailwinds are balanced by margin pressure and capital needs. Incumbents should emphasize differentiated service, supply resilience, digital integration, and selective tuck‑ins; potential entrants should focus on niche specialization, digital efficiency, and strategic partnerships rather than attempting a broad national footprint quickly.

## Industry Attractiveness

Moderate — the industrial supplies sector offers steady demand supported by manufacturing and infrastructure long‑term fundamentals and digital/automation tailwinds. However, margin pressure from buyer consolidation, price transparency and supplier/import volatility, plus capital intensity for distribution/digital investment, constrain attractiveness relative to other sectors.

## 1️⃣ Threat of New Entrants

**Threat Level:** Medium

**Capital Requirements:** Medium–High — meaningful capex for DCs/automation, vehicles, inventory and working capital; digital/platform build adds material software/people investment but pure‑play digital entrants lower physical capex

**Economies of Scale:** Strong — larger incumbents (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC) leverage scale for purchasing discounts, distribution density, inventory turns and margin expansion

**Brand Loyalty:** Medium — local service and inventory services (onsite, vending, KeepStock/KO) strengthen loyalty among mid‑large customers; smaller buyers remain price sensitive and easier to win

**Barriers to Entry:**
- High distribution & logistics cost to build national/local DC + branch network (same‑day/next‑day service expectations)
- Scale advantages in procurement, inventory, and vendor terms held by incumbents
- Need for technology investments (eCommerce, PIM, FMI connectivity, automation) and data assets
- Established customer relationships, vendor partnerships and account management teams (esp. national accounts and onsite)
- Regulatory/commercial requirements for certain product categories (safety, regulated chemicals) and standards compliance

**Key Insights:**
- E‑commerce reduced some entry barriers (lower initial capex) but does not remove the need for reliable local inventory and value‑added services for many customers.
- Incumbents’ investments in onsite, vending, FMI and DC automation raise the threshold for entrants who cannot replicate fast fulfillment and technical support.
- Regulatory complexity and government contracting accredited supplier requirements further raise entry costs for certain segments (safety, critical MRO).

## 2️⃣ Bargaining Power of Suppliers

**Power Level:** Medium

**Supplier Concentration:** Medium — many commodity and MRO suppliers worldwide, but key fastener and certain component supply is concentrated in Asia; specialty OEMs remain limited in number for some lines

**Switching Costs:** Low–Medium — distributors can often switch suppliers for commodity items, but switching is higher for specialty, custom, or long‑tail items and for private‑label relationships

**Forward Integration Threat:** Low–Medium — major suppliers or manufacturers can sell direct or via marketplaces but full forward integration into a local distribution network is costly; niche suppliers occasionally sell direct to large end customers

**Supplier Dependency:** Medium — for many commodity items dependency is low, but for certain categories (fasteners, specialty bearings, some automation components) dependency and lead‑time risk is meaningful

**Unique Resources:**
- Specialized manufacturer relationships for private‑label and proprietary product lines
- Regional manufacturing partners (fasteners, safety) with long lead times
- Integrated supplier portals and drop‑ship arrangements used by incumbents

**Key Insights:**
- Supplier power rises for categories with concentrated production (e.g., specific fastener grades, commodity steel‑derived items) and when logistics/shipping constraints exist.
- Distributors reduce supplier exposure with multi‑sourcing, private‑label agreements, and deeper integration (APIs, vendor‑managed inventory).
- Geopolitical risk, tariffs, and ocean freight volatility can temporarily increase supplier leverage even when long‑term concentration is moderate.

## 3️⃣ Bargaining Power of Buyers

**Power Level:** Medium–High

**Buyer Concentration:** Mixed — many small buyers but a growing share of revenue is concentrated in national accounts and large multisite buyers (increasing buyer clout)

**Price Sensitivity:** Moderate to High for smaller buyers and transactional products; lower for strategic customers who value inventory/services (onsite, vending, KANBAN)

**Switching Costs:** Medium — pure catalog/eCommerce buyers face low switching costs; customers using managed inventory, onsite, or integrated eProcurement face higher switching costs (process & system integration + relationship & service loss)

**Backward Integration Threat:** Low — large buyers can source direct for select categories but building the distribution infrastructure and local service model is expensive, so threat is limited to commoditized SKUs

**Information Availability:** High — internet, marketplaces and vendor data make comparison shopping easier; analytics and transparency raise buyer negotiating power

**Key Insights:**
- The rise of national accounts and eProcurement increases buyer leverage on price and contract terms; distributors must deliver demonstrable TCO reduction to retain these clients.
- Buyers using FMI/vending/onsite are less price‑sensitive and more “sticky”; investing in service and integration raises switching costs and reduces buyer bargaining power.
- Digital price transparency increases churn risk for transactional SKUs; distributors must differentiate via service, analytics and bespoke solutions.

## 4️⃣ Threat of Substitute Products/Services

**Threat Level:** Medium

**Price-Performance:** Variable — marketplaces can offer competitive pricing on common SKUs; incumbents compete on logistics, assortment, and service rather than pure price

**Switching Costs:** Variable — low for simple transactional purchases; high where distributors have implemented managed inventory, eProcurement integrations, vending or technical services

**Buyer Propensity:** Medium — buyers will substitute to lower total cost channels for transactional SKUs, but many prefer distributor solutions for reliability and integrated services

**Key Substitutes:**
- Global and general eCommerce marketplaces (including broad marketplaces and B2B arms of major retailers)
- OEMs and manufacturers selling direct to end users
- In‑house procurement (large customers consolidating purchasing operations)
- Additive manufacturing/3D printing for select spare parts and low‑volume components (longer term)

**Innovation Trends:**
- Rapid eProcurement integration and punch‑out catalogs lowering friction with ERP systems
- AI/analytics enabling predictive replenishment and automated procurement decisioning
- Additive manufacturing (3D) as a growing alternative for specific spare parts and components
- Micro‑fulfillment and same‑day local delivery services offered by digital players

**Key Insights:**
- Marketplaces and digital players pose real substitution risk for commoditized, transactional SKUs, but firms that lock in customers through managed inventory and onsite programs preserve higher margin, sticky revenue.
- Long‑term tech trends (additive manufacturing, AI) can displace some SKUs, but represent opportunities to offer advisory and implementation services.
- Distributors who fail to build compelling digital ordering, analytics and procurement integrations will see substitution accelerate.

## 5️⃣ Competitive Rivalry

**Intensity Level:** High

**Industry Concentration:** Medium — several very large incumbents (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC, WESCO, Wesco, Applied) plus many regional and local specialists; fragmentation remains high in many subsegments

**Growth Rate:** Moderate — Statifacts/MDM estimate steady mid‑single digit CAGR (2025–2034) with near‑term moderation vs. 2021–22 high inflation tailwinds

**Differentiation Level:** Medium — differentiation driven by service models (onsite, vending), digital capabilities, assortment breadth, and technical/engineering services rather than product alone

**Major Competitors:**
- W.W. Grainger — broad national scale and dual model (high‑touch + endless assortment)
- Fastenal — dense local network, Onsite/FMI strength
- MSC Industrial — tooling, MRO emphasis, strong supply chain services
- Wesco/Wesco International — electrical and industrial distribution scale
- Applied Industrial Technologies and Motion Industries — PT/bearings and industrial parts focus

**Common Strategies:**
- Scale & purchasing power to lower COGS and expand assortment
- Omni‑channel play: branch + eCommerce + FMI/vending/onsite
- Value‑added services: inventory management, technical expertise, predictive maintenance solutions
- M&A and consolidation to achieve footprint & category expansion
- Private label/house brands to protect margins and reduce supplier dependence

**Exit Barriers:**
- Investment in facilities, DCs, and fleet (capital intensity)
- Long‑term lease obligations in branch networks and distribution centers
- Contractual obligations to large national accounts and service level commitments
- Specialized workforce and local sales force knowledge tethered to markets

**Key Insights:**
- Rivalry is intense as scale, local density, and digital capability are all contested. Margin pressure remains a central competitive battleground.
- Differentiation via integrated services (FMI, vending, onsite) and data/analytics is proving more durable than price‑only competition.
- Consolidation will continue; buy‑and‑build strategies provide incumbents the fastest path to fill local/service gaps.

## Strategic Analysis

### Opportunities
- Managed inventory & vending (FMI) expansion — still underpenetrated in many industries/regions
- LIFT/micro‑fulfillment as hybrid fulfillment model to lower branch staffing costs and increase fill rates
- Nearshoring and regional supplier partnerships to reduce lead times and import exposure
- Private‑label programs to capture margin and address specific customer needs
- Value‑added digital services (procurement automation, analytics, predictive replenishment) to create recurring revenue
- Aftermarket services (repairs, calibrations, asset management) bundled with product offers

### Threats
- Growing digital market competition and marketplaces for commoditized SKUs (accelerating price pressure)
- Supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and concentrated offshore production for certain components (fasteners, bearings)
- Buyer consolidation and eProcurement increasing price leverage and reducing distributor margins
- Macro slowdown or industrial weakness that reduces demand for OEM/fastener products
- Technological substitution (3D printing, localized manufacturing) impacting low‑volume spare parts over time

### Strategic Recommendations
- Double down on sticky service models: accelerate expansion and integration of onsite, vending, and LIFT fulfillment models that raise switching costs and increase wallet share.
- Invest in pragmatic digital integration: prioritize punch‑out/ERP integrations, PIM/master data quality, AI‑driven replenishment and analytics that improve customer TCO and reduce buyer propensity to substitute.
- Strengthen supply resilience: diversify sourcing (nearshoring options), create dual‑supply agreements for critical SKUs, and expand private‑label where margin protection is viable.
- Segment customers and tailor GTM: prioritize resources for national/strategic accounts (higher bargaining power) and automate low‑touch channels for smaller transactional accounts via eCommerce/self‑service.
- Selective M&A: pursue tuck‑ins to fill geographic or capability gaps (automation, specialty categories, last‑mile fulfillment) rather than headline chase; focus on cultural fit and integration playbooks.
- Operational cost discipline: exploit DC automation, route optimization, and demand planning to reduce fulfillment cost per order while protecting service levels.
- Monetize data & services: package analytics and asset management as premium services (predictive maintenance recommendations, TCO studies) to create new revenue streams.
- ESG & sustainability as differentiator: adopt transparent sustainability reporting, low‑carbon logistics pilots, and circular product offerings to retain large customers increasingly focused on ESG metrics.

I'll search for recent annual reports and investor presentations for the major U.S. distributors (W.W. Grainger, Fastenal, MSC Industrial, HD Supply/WESCO if applicable), plus authoritative industry summaries (MDM Top Distributors, Statista/Mordor/Market reports) to gather revenue, market share, distribution channels, e-commerce adoption, and consolidation trends. After collecting those sources I'll extract the most relevant pages for detailed figures and statements to support each of Porter's Five Forces.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “forecast,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” or “would,” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.\nGrainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Grainger's control, which could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those that are presented.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: inflation, higher product costs or other expenses, including operational and administrative expenses; the impact of macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical trends, changes and events; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; changes in customer or product mix; increased competitive pricing pressures; changes in third-party practices regarding digital advertising; failure to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory basis with group purchasing organizations; failure to develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies, including with respect to Grainger's eCommerce platforms; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in Grainger's gross profit margin; Grainger's responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, regulations related to advertising, marketing and the Internet, consumer protection, pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes), product liability, compliance or safety, trade and export compliance, general commercial disputes, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, including new or stricter environmental laws or regulations; government contract matters; the impact of any government shutdown; disruption or breaches of information technology or data security systems involving Grainger or third parties on which Grainger depends; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including tariffs and trade issues and policies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including price and trading volume volatility or price declines of Grainger's common stock; commodity price volatility; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; outbreaks of pandemic disease or viral contagions; natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather and other catastrophes or conditions; effects of climate change; failure to execute on our efforts and programs related to environmental, social and governance matters; competition for, or failure to attract, retain, train, motivate and develop executives and key team members; loss of key members of management or key team members; loss of operational flexibility and potential for work stoppages or slowdowns if team members unionize or join a collective bargaining arrangement; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; Grainger's incurrence of indebtedness or failure to comply with restrictions and obligations under its debt agreements and instruments and other factors identified under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could impact Grainger's forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward looking-statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 4 PART I Item 1: Business W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nFor financial information regarding the Company, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe Grainger Edge Grainger's strategic framework, “The Grainger Edge,” uniquely defines the Company by asserting why it exists, how it serves customers and how team members work together to achieve its objectives. Grainger’s purpose is We Keep the World Working®, which in turn allows customers to focus on the core of their businesses and do what they do best. This framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities as Grainger executes its strategy and creates value for shareholders. For further information on the Company's principles, see below \"Workplace Practices and Policies.\" General Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) and Endless Assortment. These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment. For further segment information, see Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nBelow is a description of Grainger’s reportable segments and other businesses. High-Touch Solutions N.A. The Company's High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment provides value-added MRO solutions that are rooted in deep product knowledge and customer expertise. The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment primarily includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.\nEndless Assortment The Company’s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company’s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.\nOther Other businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's Cromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment. 5 Business Models Competing with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's business models: 6 Customers The Company uses a combination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million customers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger’s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost of procurement. Customers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology. Sales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock®, Grainger's inventory management solution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat. In the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.\nProducts and Services Grainger’s product offering is grouped under several broad categories, including safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools. Products are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised more than 20% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price and product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer approximately 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 13 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 22 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically adding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.\nDistribution and Sources of Supply In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering. More than 5,000 primary suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with more than 1.4 million products stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised more than 5% of Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger’s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support. Additionally, Grainger offers comprehensive inventory management through its KeepStock® program that includes vendor-managed inventory, customer-managed inventory and onsite vending machines. 7 In the Endless Assortment segment, orders are placed primarily through online channels. Zoro leverages the High-Touch Solution N.A.'s DC network and third-party drop shipments to deliver seamless service and product fulfillment to customers. MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.\nFor further information on the Company’s properties, see Part I, Item 2: Properties of this Form 10-K.\nTrademarks and Service Marks Grainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2023 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®, SPEEDAIRE®, AIR HANDLER®, TOUGH GUY®, WESTWARD®, CONDOR® and LUMAPRO®. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK® brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.\nSeasonality Grainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger’s operating results.\nCompetition Grainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support. Government Regulations Grainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. based operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2023, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.\nHuman Capital The Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger’s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board. Grainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger’s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and team member engagement.\nTeam Member Profile As of December 31, 2023, Grainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,200 were full-time and 2,900 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 85% of these team members are located in North America, 9% in Asia and 6% in Europe. 8 Workplace Practices and Policies The Company's strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.\nThe Grainger Edge principles also guide the Company’s actions supporting health and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, and team member experience, including talent acquisition and team member retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are: • Start with the Customer • Win as One Team • Embrace Curiosity • Invest in our Success • Act with Intent • Do the Right Thing • Compete with Urgency Grainger’s purpose-driven culture and principles help the Company attract, retain, motivate and develop its workforce and drive team member engagement. The Company believes an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company and measures team member engagement on an ongoing basis. The results from engagement surveys are used to inform programs and processes designed and implemented to enhance the inclusive culture Grainger aspires to achieve. Health and Safety Grainger strives to provide a safe work environment in which team members are properly prepared to perform the many tasks required to support customers. The Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to integrate EHS into Grainger’s business operations and comply with applicable regulations. To that end, the Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to confirm proper safety policies, programs and procedures. The Company is focused on promoting a culture of safety and education. Operational team members must complete routine training to fully understand the expectation of behaviors defined by the Company’s global EHS policy. Managing and reducing risks at DCs and other facilities remain a core objective and injury rates continue to be low. In 2023, the Company’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate in the U.S. was 1.3 and the Company’s Lost Time Incident Rate in the U.S. was 0.4 based upon the number of incidents per 100 team members (or per 200,000 work hours). Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Grainger believes a diverse talent pool is essential to live its principles, foster innovation, build high-performing teams and drive business results. The Company understands that future business success requires a mix of current and new skill sets, multiple experiences, and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, and strives to reflect this priority in its hiring, retention and promotion practices. The Company aspires to increasingly promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people – regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or experiences – through recruiting outreach, internal networking, business resource groups and mentoring programs.\nGrainger's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top. The Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of approximately 31% female and 23% racially and ethnically diverse directors. Grainger also maintains this strong commitment with the CEO's leadership team and throughout the organization. The CEO's U.S. based leadership team is comprised of approximately 40% women and approximately 30% racially and ethnically diverse leaders. As of December 31, 2023, within Grainger’s U.S. workforce, approximately 39% of team members were women and approximately 37% of team members were racially and ethnically diverse. Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development Grainger believes that a great customer experience starts with a great team member experience. The Company is committed to providing team members with resources designed to help them succeed. Grainger focuses on creating opportunities for team member growth, development and training, including offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout a team member’s career. This talent program is comprised of performance 9 management, career management, professional development learning opportunities and milestone leadership development programs.\nCompensation and Benefits Grainger believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate team members. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the diverse needs of team members and support their physical and mental health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Team members are given access to health plan resources which include 24-hour virtual health services, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs with access to online support communities. In addition, Grainger provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits as well as a variety of other programs.\nAvailable Information Grainger's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The risks included below are not exhaustive. As Grainger operates in a rapidly changing environment, it is not possible for management to predict all risks and the corresponding impact of each such risk or a combination of risks. The presented risks and any new risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which Grainger is exposed.\nIndustry and Market Risks Inflation could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings.\nMarket variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events, could negatively impact Grainger's ability to effectively manage its operating and administrative expenses. For example, geopolitical conflicts and related international responses have and may continue to exacerbate inflationary pressures, including increases in fuel and other energy costs. In addition, Grainger's inability to pass on increases in costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.\nDisruptions in Grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger’s logistics or supply chain network could be disrupted by the occurrence of: one or more natural or human induced disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather events or conditions; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; disruptions to transportation infrastructure and networks, including from transport providers or third-party work stoppages related to labor strikes or lockouts; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increases in costs associated with international trade. Even when Grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Grainger to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact Grainger's profitability and financial condition. Any of these circumstances could impair Grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to Grainger's reputation. Grainger’s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nFurther escalation of geopolitical tensions across the world and potential actions taken in response to them could have a broad impact on markets where Grainger does business, adversely affect its suppliers and disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of products. It is not possible to predict whether certain geopolitical events which could adversely affect Grainger's business will occur, or the broader consequences of these events if they did occur, which could include further instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy or possible sanctions, embargoes or other trade barriers.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger’s customers could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and industry trends affect Grainger’s business environment. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger’s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, interest rate fluctuations, government spending and government shutdowns, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, work stoppages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger’s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services. 13 Any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Grainger’s pricing and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in Canada, Japan, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger’s sales and results of operations.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with Grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger's products are purchased from more than 5,000 primary suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases. Disruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond Grainger’s control. These factors could include economic downturns, recessions, outbreaks of pandemic disease, natural or human induced disasters, cybersecurity attacks, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, new or increased tariffs, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems or shortages experienced by Grainger’s suppliers or others in the supply chain, transportation availability, staffing and cost, shortage of raw materials, supplier consolidation, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger’s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required, distances involved, and the range of potential consequences of various geopolitical risks. If Grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted, there could be adverse effects on inventory levels, results of operations, customer relationships and Grainger’s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing arrangements which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nFor products sold in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Grainger requires its suppliers and sub-suppliers, to comply with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics, or other similar responsible sourcing standards, as a condition of doing business with Grainger. Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics focuses on four main areas of ethical sourcing: (i) human rights and labor standards (including prohibitions on child and forced labor); (ii) environment, health and safety; (iii) sanctions, trade, bribery and corruption; and (iv) privacy and information security. The Code also addresses how to report potential Code violations and related concerns. Grainger does not control its suppliers and their sub-suppliers, and neither Grainger nor its suppliers or other partners may be able to uncover all instances of noncompliance with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics and ethical and lawful business practices. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, product recalls, or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business. Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture certain products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. The recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. The level of demand for Grainger's products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities, including fuel. Fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services, including as a result of a pandemic, could affect transportation costs. Grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, 14 the Financial Statements of Grainger’s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger’s international subsidiaries, primarily the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi and euro, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency exchange rate is driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors and fiscal decisions of various governments and central banks, all over which Grainger has no control. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect Grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition and other risks could impact demand for Grainger’s products and services.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger’s high-touch operations, eCommerce platforms and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses.\nTo remain competitive, Grainger must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. Downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause Grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. Grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. These pressures could have a material effect on Grainger’s sales and profitability. To manage these potential pressures, Grainger continuously considers the adoption of new operating initiatives, including new marketing programs, productivity improvements, inventory management and loss prevention initiatives, and other similar strategies. If Grainger is unable to sustain or grow sales, reduce costs, and prevent loss and fraud, among other actions, Grainger's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements, innovations and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. Developing, upgrading, managing or implementing new technologies, business applications, strategies and innovations may require significant investment of resources by Grainger, may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, may increase Grainger's vulnerability to cyber breaches, attacks or intrusions, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.\nThe growth of Grainger’s eCommerce platforms exposes Grainger to additional risks which could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The successful execution of Grainger’s eCommerce growth strategy depends on a number of factors, including Grainger’s investment in its eCommerce platforms, consumer preferences and purchasing trends, and the ability to deliver a seamless procurement experience across digital and also physical retail channels. As its eCommerce platforms have grown in recent years, Grainger has increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing technology information systems, software development and other capabilities to provide simplified customer interactions and to provide high-quality, user-friendly service to its customers and streamline customer interactions. Grainger has also made significant investments in digital advertising and customer acquisition and retention efforts for its eCommerce channels, including through paid and non-paid advertising such as display advertising, search engine optimization, email and mobile “push” notifications. If Grainger’s customer-facing technology systems are perceived as more difficult or less compelling for customers to use than those of Grainger’s competitors, or if digital marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these investments, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, Grainger faces many risks and uncertainties beyond the Company's control, including theft, credit card fraud, and other fraudulent behavior. 15 Grainger has also increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and large language model technologies. While the use of these technologies can present significant benefits to Grainger, it also creates risks and challenges. Further, if these investments in Grainger’s eCommerce platforms are less successful at attracting and retaining customers than similar investments by our competitors, or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these technological investments generally, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the successful operation of Grainger’s eCommerce channels depends in part upon third parties and factors over which Grainger has limited or no control. For example, Grainger relies in part on Internet search engines to drive traffic to its websites, and the reach of Grainger’s eCommerce channels is impacted by how and where its websites rank in both paid and unpaid search results. Potential changes to search engine ranking rules could cause Grainger’s websites to place lower in search results and cause Grainger to incur increased advertising costs in order to increase its visibility. Further, ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy, online tracking technologies such as cookies, digital advertising and other eCommerce matters could require Grainger to modify its eCommerce strategy, incur significant additional costs to comply with such changes or otherwise adversely affect Grainger’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Grainger also relies on email and other messaging services to promote its websites and product offerings, and changes in Grainger’s current or prospective customers’ use of email or other messaging services or actions by third parties to block, restrict or charge for the delivery of such messages could adversely affect sales through Grainger’s eCommerce channels and Grainger’s results of operations.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger’s revenue or gross margin, or affect Grainger’s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in its customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions and divestitures, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of eCommerce by Grainger and its competitors.\nIn addition, Grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. If Grainger is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with GPOs, Grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs its customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into Grainger’s existing assortment could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger’s competitive position. The inclusion of Grainger-branded products in the product assortment could subject Grainger to increased claims and litigation activity. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights, including against the manufacturer of such products, may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures.\nGrainger’s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading prices and volumes of Grainger’s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger’s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, Grainger’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchases or dividends, economic decline, political unrest or geopolitical conflict, outbreak of pandemic disease, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A. These factors, many of which are outside of Grainger’s control, could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or Grainger’s stock price to decline. Volatility in the price of Grainger's securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nGrainger has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). MonotaRO's disclosure and reporting obligations under TSE listing requirements and Japanese securities laws, including the timing of such obligations, may vary from Grainger's obligations under New York Stock Exchange 16 listing requirements and U.S. securities laws. MonotaRO's listed securities may be subject to the same volatility, price and securities litigation risks to which Grainger's common stock is subject.\nOperational Risks Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.\nThe functioning of Grainger’s information systems is critical to the operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures to effectively manage its information systems. However, Grainger may not be able to maintain or update its information systems to capture and use data in ways that result in operational efficiency, including as a result of ineffective software, difficulties obtaining the right talent and ability to manage the increasing volume of data available to, and managed by Grainger. Furthermore, although Grainger’s information systems are protected with backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third-party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. In addition, Grainger relies on the information technology (IT) systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.\nThe implementation of new systems and upgrades to existing systems could impact Grainger's operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management's time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, Grainger's systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other IT disruption could have an adverse effect on its business.\nIf Grainger’s systems or those of third parties on which Grainger depends are damaged, breached, cease to function properly or are otherwise disrupted, Grainger may require a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interim interruptions in its business operations. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, Grainger’s ability to operate its eCommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store team member or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations. Grainger has experienced these incidents in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage Grainger’s reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nThrough Grainger’s sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on Grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with Grainger. Moreover, Grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and team member, and other sensitive matters.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in Grainger's information systems. Loss of customer, supplier, and team member information, intellectual property or other business information, or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could, for example, disrupt operations, damage Grainger’s reputation and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Grainger, including its financial condition and results of operations. If successful, cyber-attacks may expose Grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations. The transition in recent years to remote and “hybrid” working arrangements may increase Grainger’s vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage Grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose Grainger to claims or other actions from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others. 17 Grainger's IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers, vendors and other third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information. Moreover, Grainger shares information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business. Although Grainger performs risk assessments on third parties where appropriate to learn about their security program, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. Moreover, Grainger may face threats to its information systems, for example, unauthorized access, business email compromise, viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, and organized cyber-attacks. If successful, those attempting to penetrate Grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, team member or business information, or cause systems disruption. While many of Grainger's agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions, Grainger may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur.\nIn addition, a Grainger team member, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures or otherwise access Grainger’s information. Grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems and a breach of Grainger's systems could be used as an attempt to gain illicit access to customer systems and information. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger's business, operations or financial condition. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until they are launched against a target. Grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventative measures. Any breach of Grainger’s security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third-party service providers could cause Grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, team members and other parties whose information is compromised. Such a breach could also cause Grainger to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. Although Grainger maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks, depending on the nature, location and extent of any event, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nGrainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents and in each instance Grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. None of these incidents have been deemed to be material to Grainger and Grainger has neither incurred any material net expenses nor been materially penalized or subject to any material settlement amounts with respect to such incidents in the last three years. However, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to Grainger’s operations and financial condition.\nFor further information regarding Grainger's cybersecurity risk management strategy and the Board's oversight role, see Part I, Item 1C: Cybersecurity of this Form 10-K.\nGrainger’s eCommerce channels are subject to risks related to online payment methods and other online transactions, including through purchasing platforms.\nGrainger accepts a variety of payment methods via its eCommerce channels, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and other payment methods and other online transactions, including through its eProcurement technologies which communicate directly with Grainger.com and Grainger's other eCommerce channels. Although Grainger generally relies on third parties to facilitate eCommerce payments and payment processing services, Grainger may become subject to additional compliance requirements and regulations regarding these transactions, and may also suffer losses from online fraudulent transactions on its eCommerce channels. In addition, Grainger must pay certain transaction fees relating to these transactions, which may increase over time and could have an impact on product margin, profitability and operating costs. Grainger’s eCommerce channels may become subject to further rules and regulations, and changes in these rules and regulations, or their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect results of operations.\nGrainger’s inability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. 18 Grainger’s business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of Grainger’s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect Grainger’s rights. In addition, Grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject Grainger to liability, require Grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause Grainger to modify its operations.\nIn order to compete, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop and retain key team members, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nIn order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop, and retain executives and other key team members, including those in managerial, technical, sales, supply chain, technology development and information technology positions. Grainger competes to hire team members at increasingly competitive wage rates and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Qualified individuals needed to fill open positions may be in short supply in some areas. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect Grainger's labor costs. Competition for qualified team members could require Grainger to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of team members. Additionally collective bargaining or unionization of team members could decrease Grainger's operational flexibility and lead to work stoppages or slowdowns. The performance of Grainger’s stock price could impact Grainger’s use of equity-based compensation to attract and retain executives and other key team members. The success of Grainger's team member hiring and retention also depends on Grainger's ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its team members to thrive.\nGenerally, higher wages and benefit costs, competition for diverse talent, and the risk of an increase in team member turnover, could adversely affect Grainger's results of operations. Further, failure to successfully hire executives and key team members or adequately plan for the succession, transition, and assimilation of executive leaders and team members in key roles, or to plan for the loss of executives and key team members, could adversely affect Grainger's business results and financial condition. Grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger’s reputation.\nOne of the reasons customers choose to do business with Grainger and team members choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. Grainger devotes time and resources to environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation, including programs driving environmental sustainability, ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity, equity and inclusion, and gender equality. These efforts and programs could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement, and Grainger’s actual or perceived failure to execute its ESG programs as planned could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, business and financial performance. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger’s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business.\nRegulatory, Legal and Tax Risks Grainger is subject to a complex array of laws, regulations and standards globally. Failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation and other regulatory proceedings could adversely affect Grainger's financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nGrainger’s business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., and its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan.\nThe wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each jurisdiction where Grainger operates, include, but are not limited to, advertising, marketing and Internet regulations (including the use of proprietary or third-party “cookies” in connection with Grainger’s eCommerce platforms), anti-bribery and corruption laws, competition and antitrust regulations, data protection (including, because Grainger accepts credit cards, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act and Privacy Rights Act, 19 in Japan, the Act on Protection of Personal Information, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, currency exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export compliance (including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and anti-money laundering regulations), intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to U.S. taxes on international subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. Moreover, Grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties, remediation costs and/or significant legal fees as well as potential damage to Grainger’s reputation. Changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. Furthermore, while Grainger has implemented policies and procedures and provides training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that team members, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or Grainger’s policies. Any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.\nGrainger’s contracts with federal, state and local government entities are subject to various and changing regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. In addition, Grainger’s government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. From time to time, Grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. Violations of these terms, rules, and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. Any such penalties could result in damage to Grainger’s reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn conducting its business, Grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by Grainger’s products or services.\nGrainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. Grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, environmental or property damage or other commercial disputes, and the types of matters discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The defense of any proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management’s time and attention, and Grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that Grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures. Grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. Grainger's reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. Tax changes could affect Grainger’s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nGrainger’s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of Grainger’s relative overall profitability and the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of Grainger's tax exposures. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two guidelines address the increasing digitization of the global economy, re-allocating taxing rights among countries. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected during 2024. Grainger continues to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods. Based on information to date, Grainger does not expect either the Pillar One or Two proposals to materially impact the Company’s global income tax liability or effective tax rate. 20 Grainger may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations designed to address climate change. The potential impacts of climate change on Grainger’s suppliers, product offerings, operations, facilities and customers are accelerating and uncertain. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change have resulted in, and may continue to result in, more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that have resulted in, and could continue to result in, more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. New laws, regulations and enforcement could strain Grainger’s suppliers and result in increased compliance-related costs, which could result in higher product costs that are passed to Grainger. New or changing environmental laws and regulations could also increase Grainger’s operating costs, including through higher utility and transportation costs, and Grainger is unable to predict the potential impact such laws and regulations could have on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy and product demand, impact Grainger's transportation costs and supply chain network, and could increase Grainger’s operating costs. Natural disasters as a result of climate change at locations where Grainger, its suppliers or customers operate could cause disruptions to Grainger’s operations, which could adversely affect sales and could negatively impact Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If environmental laws, regulations, and other stakeholder requirements impose significant operational restrictions or compliance requirements upon Grainger or its suppliers, products, or customers, or Grainger's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, Grainger's business, capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Changes in Grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.\nGrainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial strength and factors outside of Grainger’s control, such as conditions affecting Grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of Grainger’s securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the Company’s existing credit facilities or on future financings.\nGrainger has incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent Grainger from fulfilling its obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. The Company’s indebtedness could, among other things, limit Grainger’s ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the Company’s financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe agreements governing Grainger’s debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. Grainger’s failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow Grainger’s creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.\nIn addition, Grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes. Grainger’s ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on, among other things, the Company’s financial condition, prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments None.\nItem 1C: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Grainger has a cybersecurity team that works to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats. The team has implemented processes designed to assess, identify and manage material risks and vulnerabilities to the Company’s security posture, including prioritizing and remediating such risks. The team also works to assess and manage cybersecurity risks by: (i) reviewing cyber risks with senior management, including the Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO); (ii) incorporating cybersecurity in its enterprise risk processes; (iii) establishing regular reviews of cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts, including with the Audit Committee and the Board; and (iv) using third parties as needed for reviews and testing. Grainger regularly identifies its enterprise risks. Grainger’s cybersecurity team reviews and updates its information security strategy and plans to align cybersecurity prioritization with the identified top enterprise risks. Grainger has developed a cybersecurity risk intake process to facilitate the identification of cybersecurity risks, including those related to third-party vendors. Identified risks are tracked by management, and incorporated into mitigation plans. The management team engaged in the cybersecurity risk management process, including the CTO, has risk management backgrounds, certifications, and/or cyber experience in prior professional roles and at Grainger. The team maintains expertise on cyber risk management through third-party consultants, external trainings, and affiliations with relevant organizations. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access of systems on which certain supplier, customer, and team member information was stored, which have been deemed immaterial to our business and operations individually and in the aggregate. Grainger, or third-party service providers engaged by Grainger, may be subject to other unauthorized access of information systems in the future. There can be no assurance that any future unauthorized access to or breach of these information systems will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and processes, including with respect to cybersecurity. Both the Board and the Audit Committee regularly review the Company’s risk assessment and management processes and policies and receive regular updates from the Company’s management team members who are responsible for the effectiveness of the Company’s ERM program. As part of its ERM oversight, the Board oversees and regularly reviews the Company’s programs and processes for cybersecurity risks, including the Company’s framework for preventing, detecting, and addressing cybersecurity incidents and identifying emerging risks both broadly and within related industries. The Company’s CTO routinely provides cybersecurity updates to the Audit Committee and information to the Board. The CTO leads an information security team that works to facilitate the protection of the Company’s information and computing assets. 22 Item 2: Properties As of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled approximately 30.4 million square feet.

Grainger, Inc. (Grainger or Company) as it is viewed by the Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in MD&A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nPercentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.\nOverview W.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.\nStrategic Priorities The Company’s continued strategic aspiration for 2024 is to relentlessly expand Grainger’s leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To achieve this, each Grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and MRO market outgrowth. In the High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) segment, businesses are focused on three areas: advantaged MRO solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. In the Endless Assortment segment, businesses are focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. Additionally, all Grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.\nRecent Events Inflationary Cost Environment and Macroeconomic Pressures The global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. These disruptions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, inflation and a potential recession on the Company’s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. As a result of continued inflation, the Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs while also remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company’s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company’s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFor further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 26 Results of Operations In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" The following table is included as an aid to understanding the changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions of dollars). For the Years Ended December 31, % of Net Sales 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 Net sales(1) $ 16,478 $ 15,228 8.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 9,982 9,379 6.4 60.6 61.6 Gross profit 6,496 5,849 11.1 39.4 38.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,931 3,634 8.2 23.8 23.9 Operating earnings 2,565 2,215 15.8 15.6 14.5 Other expense – net 65 69 (5.5) 0.4 0.4 Income tax provision 597 533 12.0 3.6 3.5 Net earnings 1,903 1,613 18.0 11.6 10.6 Less noncontrolling interest 74 66 12.5 0.5 0.4 Net earnings attributable to W.W.

Daily, organic constant currency net sales excludes the results of E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture and excludes the impact on net sales due to year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. There were 254 and 255 sales days in the full year 2023 and 2022, respectively. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" Net sales of $16,478 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,250 million, or 8%, and on a daily, organic constant currency basis, net sales increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. Both High-Touch Solutions N.A. and the Endless Assortment segments contributed to sales growth in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's net sales, see the Segment Analysis section below.\nGross profit of $6,496 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $647 million, or 11%, and gross profit margin of 39.4% increased 100 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Both segments contributed to margin expansion in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's gross profit, see the Segment Analysis section below. 27 Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $3,931 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $297 million, or 8%. Adjusted SG&A of $3,905 million increased $250 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2022 driven by higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points in 2023. Operating earnings of $2,565 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $350 million, or 16%. Adjusted operating earnings of $2,591 million increased $397 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by increased SG&A consistent with sales growth in 2023. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in 2023. Income tax expense of $597 million and $533 million represents effective tax rates of 23.9% and 24.8% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was positively impacted by increased benefits related to stock compensation in 2023. Diluted earnings per share was $36.23 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $36.67 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 24% compared to $29.66 for the same period in 2022. 28 Non-GAAP Measures Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. Organic net sales results exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and results of certain divested businesses in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture. Adjusted results including adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Business Divestitures In the fourth quarter of 2023, Grainger divested E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. (E&R) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in SG&A. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Grainger divested Cromwell's wholly owned software business in the U.K. and recorded a one-time pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $21 million in SG&A. The Company does not expect these business exits to have a material effect on its future results of operations. 29 The following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, High-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment Total Company(1) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 13,267 8.9 % $ 2,916 4.7 % $ 16,478 8.2 % Daily impact(3) 0.2 0.4 — 0.4 0.3 0.4 Daily net sales 52.4 9.3 11.5 5.1 65.2 8.6 Foreign currency exchange(4) — — 0.6 5.3 0.6 0.9 Business divestiture(5) — 0.1 — — — — Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 52.4 9.4 % $ 12.1 10.4 % $ 65.8 9.5 % 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 12,182 19.6 % $ 2,787 8.2 % $ 15,228 16.9 % Daily impact(3) (0.2) (0.5) — (0.5) (0.2) (0.4) Daily net sales 47.6 19.1 10.9 7.7 59.5 16.5 Foreign currency exchange(4) 0.1 0.2 1.3 12.4 1.5 2.8 Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 47.7 19.3 % $ 12.2 20.1 % 61.0 19.3 % (1) Total Company includes Other.

Segment Analysis In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see above \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" For further segment information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 13,267 $ 12,182 8.9 % Gross profit 5,546 4,951 12.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,212 2,968 8.2 Operating earnings $ 2,334 $ 1,983 17.7 % Net sales of $13,267 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,085 million, or 9% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to volume of 5% and price, which includes customer mix, of 4%. Gross profit of $5,546 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $595 million, or 12%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% increased 120 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies in 2023. 32 SG&A of $3,212 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $244 million, or 8%, and adjusted SG&A of $3,186 million increased $218 million, or 7% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022.\nOperating earnings of $2,334 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $351 million, or 18%, and adjusted operating earnings of $2,360 million increased $377 million, or 19% compared to the same period in 2022. Endless Assortment The following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 2,916 $ 2,787 4.7 % Gross profit 864 817 5.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 631 594 6.2 Operating earnings $ 233 $ 223 4.3 % Net sales of $2,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $129 million, or 5%, and on a daily constant currency basis, increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to sales growth of 10%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise growth at MonotaRO, partially offset by declining sales at Zoro and non-core, consumer-like customers for the segment. Sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.\nGross profit of $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $47 million, or 6%, and gross profit margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight efficiencies at MonotaRO partially offset by unfavorable product mix at Zoro in 2023.\nSG&A of $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll and benefit expenses to support the continued growth of the segment in 2023. SG&A leverage decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Operating earnings of $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.\nSources of Liquidity Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and $325 million, respectively. The increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and favorable year-over-year working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher volume of share repurchases. The Company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of December 31, 2023. 33 Cash Flows The following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,031 $ 1,333 Investing activities (422) (263) Financing activities (1,278) (972) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4 (14) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 335 $ 84 Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,031 million and $1,333 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The increase compared to the prior year period primarily reflects increased U.S. supply chain investments including capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives, as well as technology enhancements across the Company. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,278 million and $972 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher treasury stock repurchases.\nDebt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. For further information regarding the Company's debt instruments and available financing sources, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 40.1% and 45.9%, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Ratings Grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade. The following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings as of December 31, 2023: Corporate Senior Unsecured Short-term Moody's A2 A2 P1 S&P A+ A+ A1 Uses of Liquidity Internally generated cash flows are the primary source of Grainger's working capital and growth initiatives, including 34 capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWorking Capital Working capital as of December 31, 2023 was $3,078 million, an increase of $214 million compared to $2,864 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to sustained sales growth and inventory management driven by supply chain efficiencies compared to the prior year period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. Capital Expenditures In fiscal 2023, the Company's capital expenditures were $445 million and $256 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital project spending for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $400 and $500 million. This includes continued supply chain capacity expansion and technology enhancements across the Company. With Grainger's strategic plan to expand its distribution network, the Company completed land purchases in Oregon and Texas in the second and fourth quarters of 2023 for construction of approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 square foot distribution centers (DC), respectively.\nShare Repurchases For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for $850 million and $603 million, respectively. Share repurchases are executed at prices the Company determines appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and the Company's financial performance and may be affected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Share repurchases for 2024 are expected to be in the range of $900 and $1,100 million.\nDividends For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger declared and paid $392 million and $370 million, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company's common stock. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations The Company's material cash requirements include the following commitments and other contractual obligations. Debt As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding debt obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,337 million, with $34 million payable within 12 months. Total future interest payments associated with the Company's outstanding debt obligations was $1,729 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations Grainger had purchase obligations of approximately $1,453 million as of December 31, 2023, which includes approximately $1,175 million payable within 12 months. Grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory, uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment and other goods and services. Purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs and are primarily noncancelable.\nLeases The Company has lease arrangements for certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space). As of December 31, 2023, the Company had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $492 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months. 35 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Grainger’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The majority of the Company’s inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. The Company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. If business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. For further information on the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nContingencies and Legal Matters The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. For further information on the Company's contingencies and legal matters, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 36 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Grainger's primary market risk exposures is as follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Grainger’s financial results, including the value of assets and liabilities, are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units outside the U.S., as stated in their local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 18% of the Company's net sales were denominated in a currency other than the Company's functional U.S. dollar currency. Consequently, the Company is exposed to the impact of exchange rate volatility primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nInterest Rate Risks Grainger is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt. In February 2020, Grainger entered into certain derivative instrument agreements to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt to manage this risk. The annualized effect of a hypothetical 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on Grainger’s variable-rate debt obligations would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nFor debt and derivative instrument information, see Note 5 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risks Grainger’s transportation costs are exposed to fluctuations in the price of fuel and some sourced products contain commodity-priced materials. The Company regularly monitors commodity trends and, as a broad line supplier, mitigates any material exposure to commodity price risk by having alternative sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of supplier concentration, passing commodity-related inflation to customers or suppliers and continuing to scale its distribution networks, including its transportation infrastructure. 37 Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 38 Valuation of Goodwill for the Canadian Reporting Unit Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the goodwill balance of the Canada business reporting unit was $124 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment analysis is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as projections of future operating expenditures, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our audit procedures included, among others obtaining an understanding, evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumption described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Canada business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and involving our valuation specialists to assist in testing the significant assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix, and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 39 W.W.

Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, the endless assortment business in Japan, with the residual representing the noncontrolling interest. The Company reports MonotaRO on a one-month calendar lag allowing for the timely preparation of financial statements. This one-month reporting lag is with the exception of significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform with the current year presentation. The Company reclassified amounts to separately disclose Non-cash lease expense as an adjustment to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities and Operating lease liabilities as a change in operating assets and liabilities. Previously, the net activity for these amounts were included in Depreciation and amortization. The change had no effect on previously reported results including net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nForeign Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the Company's reporting currency for all periods presented. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Translation gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive earnings (losses). Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a sales arrangement with a customer exists (e.g., contract, purchase orders, others), the transaction price is fixed or determinable and the Company has satisfied its performance obligation per the sales arrangement. The majority of Company revenue originates from contracts with a single performance obligation to deliver products, whereby performance obligations are satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer per the arranged shipping terms. Some Company contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations and are satisfied when the services are rendered. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for approximately 1% of the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company’s revenue is measured at the determinable transaction price, net of any variable considerations granted to customers and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Variable considerations include rights to return products and sales incentives, which primarily consist of volume rebates. These variable considerations are estimated throughout the year based on various factors, including contract terms, historical experience and performance levels. Total accrued sales returns were approximately $52 million and $38 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as a reduction of Accounts receivable – net. Total accrued sales incentives were approximately $114 million and $102 45 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as part of Accrued expenses.\nThe Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events other than the passage of time. The Company also records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligation. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations, contract assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes the purchase cost of goods sold net of vendor considerations, in-bound shipping costs, outbound shipping and handling costs and service costs. The Company receives vendor considerations, such as rebates to promote their products, which are generally recorded as a reduction to COGS. Rebates earned from vendors that are based on product purchases are capitalized into inventory and rebates earned based on products sold are credited directly to COGS. Total accrued vendor rebates were $155 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported in Trade accounts payable. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) Company SG&A is primarily comprised of payroll and benefits, advertising, depreciation and amortization, lease, indirect purchasing, supply chain and branch operations, technology, and selling expenses, as well as other types of general and administrative costs.\nAdvertising Advertising costs, which include online marketing, are generally expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented or when incurred. Total advertising expense was $638 million, $519 million and $402 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Incentive Plans The Company measures all share-based payments using fair-value-based methods and records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Also, the Company evaluates deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required using a “more likely than not” standard. This assessment considers the nature, frequency and amount of book and taxable income and losses, the duration of statutory carryback and forward periods, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, among other matters.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties to its tax uncertainties in the provision for income taxes.\nOther Comprehensive Earnings (Losses) The Company's Other comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrecognized gains (losses) on postretirement and other employment-related benefit plans. Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) (AOCE) are presented separately as part of shareholders' equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 46 Concentration of Credit Risk The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. Also, the Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries across North America, Japan and U.K. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company’s accounts receivable arises primarily from sales on credit to customers and are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company establishes allowances for credit losses on customer accounts that are potentially uncollectible. These allowances are determined based on several factors, including the age of the receivables, historical collection trends and economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. The allowance is determined by using the loss-rate method, which requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers.\nInventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale. The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or market, to account for approximately 77% of total inventory and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, for the remaining inventory. The Company regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and records excess and obsolete provisions representing the difference between excess and obsolete inventories and market value. Estimated market value considers various variables, including product demand, aging and shelf life, market conditions, and liquidation or disposition history and values. If FIFO had been used for all of the Company’s inventories, they would have been $770 million and $693 million higher than reported as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Concurrently, net earnings would have increased by $58 million, $139 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty, Buildings and Equipment Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the asset classes using the straight-line method. Useful lives for buildings, structures and improvements range from 10 to 50 years and furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment from three to 15 years. Amounts expended for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Long-Lived Assets The carrying value of long-lived assets, primarily property, buildings and equipment and amortizable intangibles, is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, are less than their carrying value. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nLeases The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding current and long-term lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. 47 ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement or possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of lease payments is determined using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate, the ROU asset and the lease liability are re-evaluated upon a lease modification.\nCertain lease agreements include variable lease payments that primarily include payments for non-lease components including pass-through operating expenses such as certain maintenance costs and utilities, and payments for non-components such as real estate taxes and insurance. Lease agreements with fixed lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. Certain of the Company’s lease arrangements contain renewal provisions from one to 30 years, exercisable at the Company's option. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company’s operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in SG&A.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets In a business acquisition, the Company recognizes goodwill as the excess purchase price of an acquired reporting unit over the net amount assigned to assets acquired including intangible assets and liabilities assumed. Acquired intangibles include both assets with indefinite lives and assets that are subject to amortization, which are amortized straight-line over their estimated useful lives. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The Company performs qualitative assessments of significant events and circumstances, such as reporting units' historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, strategic initiatives and overall economic factors to determine the existence of impairment indicators and assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value that would necessitate a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative test, Grainger compares the carrying value of the reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset with its fair value. Any excess of the carrying value over fair value is recorded as an impairment charge, presented as part of SG&A.\nThe fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. Estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value.\nThe Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The key assumptions when valuing a trade name are the revenue base, the royalty rate and the discount rate.\nAdditionally, the Company capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development of internal-use software, which are presented as intangible assets. Amortization of capitalized software is on a straight-line basis over three or five years.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Company uses statistical methods and qualitative comparisons of critical terms. The extent to which a derivative has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item is assessed and 48 documented periodically. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company classifies them as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.\nContingencies The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is both probable and estimable. If the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded, but the loss contingency and the reasons to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed. If a loss is reasonably possible, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. For further discussion on the Company's contingencies, see Note 14.

The Company's presentation of revenue by segment and industry most reasonably depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic and market-specific factors. In addition, the segments have unique underlying risks associated with customer purchasing behaviors. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, more than two-thirds of revenue is derived from customer contracts whereas in the Endless Assortment segment, a majority of revenue is derived from non-contractual purchases.\nThe following table presents the Company's percentage of revenue by reportable segment and by major customer industry: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022(1) 2021(1) High-Touch Solutions N.A.

Other accounts for approximately 1%, 2% and 2% of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(3) Other primarily includes revenue from industries and customers that are not material individually, including hospitality, restaurants, property management and natural resources. 50 NOTE 3 - PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT Grainger's property, buildings and equipment consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land and land improvements $ 397 $ 318 Building, structures and improvements 1,469 1,463 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 1,852 1,662 Property, buildings and equipment $ 3,718 $ 3,443 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,060 1,982 Property, buildings and equipment – net $ 1,658 $ 1,461 Depreciation expense on property, buildings and equipment was $146 million, $139 million and $123 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 4 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Grainger completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. Based on the results of that testing, the Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts at each respective period.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A. – Canada Business As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Canada business reporting unit had goodwill of $124 million and $121 million, respectively. As part of our annual impairment testing, the Company compared the current results to forecasted expectations of the most recent quantitative analysis, along with analyzing macroeconomic conditions, current industry trends and transactions, and other market data of industry peers. The Company also performed various sensitivities over key assumptions, including projections of future operating expenditures used in the analysis. The Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators for its Canada business, and concluded it was more likely than not its fair value exceeded its carrying value. The Company's balances and changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill by segment are as follows (in millions of dollars): High-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment Total Balance at January 1, 2022 $ 321 $ 63 $ 384 Translation (8) (5) (13) Balance at December 31, 2022 313 58 371 Translation 2 (3) (1) Balance at December 31, 2023 $ 315 $ 55 $ 370 Grainger's cumulative goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2023, was $137 million. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 51 The balances and changes in intangible assets – net are as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Weighted average life Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Customer lists and relationships 10.7 years $ 166 $ 153 $ 13 $ 217 $ 181 $ 36 Trademarks, trade names and other 14.9 years 31 23 8 32 22 10 Non-amortized trade names and other Indefinite 20 — 20 22 — 22 Capitalized software 4.2 years 659 466 193 580 416 164 Total intangible assets 6.1 years $ 876 $ 642 $ 234 $ 851 $ 619 $ 232 Amortization expense of intangible assets recorded in SG&A was $64 million, $61 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for future periods is as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Expense 2024 $ 66 2025 58 2026 46 2027 28 2028 13 Thereafter 3 Total $ 214 52 NOTE 5 - DEBT Total debt, including long-term, current maturities and debt issuance costs and discounts – net, consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value 4.60% senior notes due 2045 $ 1,000 $ 967 $ 1,000 $ 916 1.85% senior notes due 2025 500 483 500 470 4.20% senior notes due 2047 400 361 400 338 3.75% senior notes due 2046 400 336 400 317 Japanese yen term loan 32 32 69 69 Other (13) (13) (29) (29) Subtotal 2,319 2,166 2,340 2,081 Less current maturities (34) (34) (35) (35) Debt issuance costs – net of amortization (19) (19) (21) (21) Long-term debt $ 2,266 $ 2,113 $ 2,284 $ 2,025 Revolving Credit Facility In October 2023, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (2023 Credit Facility). Grainger may obtain loans in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding $1.25 billion, which may be increased up to $1.875 billion at the request of the Company, subject to obtaining additional commitments and other customary conditions. The primary purpose of the 2023 Credit Facility is to support the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. The 2023 Credit Facility replaced the Company's former $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of February 2020 (2020 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to mature in February 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility was terminated in October 2023.\nThere were no borrowings outstanding under the Company's 2023 Credit Facility and terminated 2020 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Senior Notes In the years 2015-2020, Grainger issued $2.3 billion in unsecured long-term debt (senior notes) primarily to provide flexibility in funding general working capital needs, share repurchases and long-term cash requirements. The senior notes require no principal payments until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. The Company incurred debt issuance costs related to the senior notes representing underwriting fees and other expenses. These costs were recorded as a contra-liability in Long-term debt and are being amortized over the term of the senior notes using the straight-line method to Interest expense – net. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unamortized costs were $19 million and $21 million, respectively.\nGrainger uses interest rate swaps to manage the risks associated with the 1.85% senior notes. These swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. The resulting carrying value adjustments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in Other in the table above. For further discussion on the Company's hedge accounting policies and derivative instruments, see Note 11.\nTerm Loan In August 2020, MonotaRO entered into a ¥9 billion term loan agreement to fund technology investments and the expansion of its distribution center (DC) network. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the term loan, including current maturities due within one year, was $32 million and $69 million, respectively. The term loan matures in 2024, payable over two equal remaining semi-annual principal installments in 2024 and bears an average interest rate of 0.05%. 53 Fair Value The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior notes was based on available external pricing data and current market rates for similar debt instruments, among other factors, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company's debt instruments include affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for companies with similar credit ratings and do not contain any financial performance covenants. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries utilize various financing sources for working capital purposes and other operating needs. These financing sources in aggregate were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe scheduled aggregate principal payments required on the Company's indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within the debt arrangements, for the succeeding five years, excluding debt issuance costs and the impact of derivatives, are due as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Payment Amount 2024 $ 34 2025 503 2026 — 2027 — 2028 — Thereafter 1,800 Total $ 2,337 NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company provides various retirement benefits to eligible team members, including contributions to defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and other benefits. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on team member location. Various foreign benefit plans cover team members in accordance with local legal requirements.\nDefined Contribution Plans A majority of the Company's U.S. team members are covered by a retirement savings plan, which provides for an automatic contribution equal to 6% of the eligible team member's total eligible compensation. The total retirement savings plan expense was $85 million, $87 million, and $78 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company sponsors additional defined contribution plans available to certain U.S. and foreign team members for which contributions are made by the Company and participating team members. The expense associated with these defined contribution plans totaled $21 million, $11 million and $16 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPostretirement Healthcare Benefits Plans The Company has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides coverage for certain U.S. team members. Covered team members become eligible for participation when they qualify for retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the Company. 54 The net periodic benefits costs were valued with a measurement date of January 1 for each year and consisted of the following components (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 SG&A Service cost $ 2 $ 4 $ 5 Other (income) expense Interest cost 5 4 3 Expected return on assets (6) (8) (8) Amortization of prior service credit (10) (10) (9) Amortization of unrecognized gains (7) (9) (8) Net periodic benefits $ (16) $ (19) $ (17) Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit asset, which is calculated as of December 31 measurement date, the fair value of plan assets available for benefits and the funded status of the benefit asset follow (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 112 $ 153 Service cost 2 4 Interest cost 5 4 Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Actuarial loss (gains) 2 (40) Benefits paid (10) (12) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 114 $ 112 Plan assets available for benefits at beginning of year $ 162 $ 207 Actual returns on plan assets 18 (36) Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Benefits paid (10) (12) Plan assets available for benefits at end of year 173 162 Noncurrent postretirement benefit asset $ 59 $ 50 The amounts recognized in AOCE consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Prior service credit $ 23 $ 33 Unrecognized gains 79 77 Deferred tax liability (25) (28) Net accumulated gains $ 77 $ 82 The Company has elected to amortize the amount of net unrecognized gains over a period equal to the average remaining service period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits of approximately 10 years for 2023.\nThe postretirement benefit obligation is determined by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models. These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, mortality and cost-sharing between the Company and the retirees. The actuarial loss recognized during the plan year is primarily related to the change in discount rate assumption. 55 The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic benefit costs as of January 1: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.92 % 2.57 % 2.17 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.50 % 6.50 % 5.81 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2030 2026 The following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.73 % 4.92 % 2.57 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.20 % 7.50 % 6.50 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2033 2030 The Company's investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and seeks to reach a balance allocation between Fixed Income securities and Equities of approximately 65% and 35%, respectively. Current allocations may differ from targeted allocations based on investment results and other timing factors. The plan's assets are stated at fair value, which represents the net asset value of shares held by the plan in the registered investment companies at the quoted market prices (Level 1 input) or at significant other observable inputs (Level 2 input). The plan assets available for benefits consisted of the following as of December 31 (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Asset class: Level 1 inputs: Mutual funds: Funds – municipal/provincial bonds $ — $ 8 Funds – corporate bonds fund 10 3 Level 2 inputs: Fixed income: Corporate bonds 56 57 Government/municipal bonds 9 12 Equity funds 88 73 Plan assets 163 153 Trust assets 10 9 Plan assets available for benefits $ 173 $ 162 56 The Company forecasts the following benefit payments related to postretirement (which include a projection for expected future team member service) for the next ten years (in millions of dollars): Year Estimated Gross Benefit Payments 2024 $ 9 2025 10 2026 10 2027 9 2028 8 2029-2033 41 Total $ 87 NOTE 7 - LEASES The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company’s lease portfolio consists mainly of operating leases that expire at various dates through 2037. Information related to operating leases is as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets Operating lease right-of-use $ 429 $ 367 Operating lease liabilities Operating lease liability 71 68 Long-term operating lease liability 381 318 Total operating lease liabilities $ 452 $ 386 As of December 31, 2023 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 7 years Weighted average incremental borrowing rate 2.19 % 1.46 % Cash paid for operating leases $ 88 $ 76 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 161 $ 96 Rent expense was $102 million, $93 million and $74 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $2 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021. 57 The remaining maturity of existing lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Operating Leases 2024 $ 87 2025 87 2026 76 2027 66 2028 57 Thereafter 119 Total lease payments 492 Less interest (40) Present value of lease liabilities $ 452 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's finance leases and service contracts with lease arrangements were not material. Finance leases are reported in Property, buildings and equipment – net, and as a short and long-term finance lease liability in Accrued expenses and Other non-current liabilities.\nNOTE 8 - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS The Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to team members and executives, which include restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares and deferred stock units. As of December 31, 2023, there were 1.4 million shares available for grant under the plans. When awards are exercised or settled, shares of the Company’s treasury stock are issued.\nPretax stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A was $62 million, $48 million, and $42 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was primarily comprised of RSUs. Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $34 million, $19 million, and $21 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units The Company awards RSUs to certain team members and executives. RSUs vest generally over periods from one to seven years from issuance. The RSU grant date fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day preceding the date of the grant.

Grainger currently enters into certain derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge against these risks, and may continue to do so in the future.\nFair Value Hedges The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt. These swaps are treated as fair value hedges and consequently the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense – net. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $450 million and $500 million, respectively.\nThe liability hedged by the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the hedged item, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments totaled $432 million and $466 million, respectively. The Company's interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of the Company's interest rate swaps were $16 million and $34 million, respectively.\nThe effect of the Company's fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in Interest expense – net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are shown in the following table (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Gain or (loss): Interest rate swaps: Hedged item $ (15) $ 35 Derivatives designated as hedging instrument $ 15 $ (35) Fair Value The estimated fair values of the Company's derivative instruments were based on quoted market forward rates, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy and reflect the present value of the amount that the Company would pay for contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates. 60 NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by geographical area consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 U.S.\n$ 2,211 $ 1,903 $ 1,267 Foreign 289 243 218 Total $ 2,500 $ 2,146 $ 1,485 Income tax expense consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Current income tax expense: U.S. Federal $ 431 $ 374 $ 221 U.S. State 100 77 46 Foreign 81 78 81 Total current 612 529 348 Deferred income tax (benefit) expense (15) 4 23 Total income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 The income tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the net deferred tax asset (liability) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses 177 150 U.S. and foreign loss carryforwards 84 62 Accrued employment-related benefits 51 51 Tax credit carryforward 22 26 Other 30 23 Deferred tax assets 364 312 Less valuation allowance (93) (71) Deferred tax assets – net of valuation allowance $ 271 $ 241 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, buildings, equipment and other capital assets (238) (212) Intangibles (58) (64) Inventory (11) (18) Other (11) (11) Deferred tax liabilities (318) (305) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) The net deferred tax asset (liability) is classified as follows: Noncurrent assets $ 10 $ 12 Noncurrent liabilities (foreign) (57) (76) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) 61 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $335 million and $248 million, respectively, of gross loss carryforwards related to foreign operations and U.S. transactions. Some of the loss carryforwards may expire at various dates through 2043. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance, which represents a provision for uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards and deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The Company's valuation allowance changed as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ (71) $ (70) Increases primarily related to foreign NOLs (5) (10) Releases primarily related to foreign NOLs 1 1 Foreign exchange rate changes (2) 4 Increase related to U.S. foreign tax credits 3 1 Increase related to capital loss carryforwards (19) — Other changes – net — 3 Balance at end of period $ (93) $ (71) A reconciliation of income tax expense with federal income taxes at the statutory rate follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Federal income tax $ 525 $ 451 $ 312 State income taxes – net of federal income tax benefit 74 64 41 Stock compensation (16) (5) (8) Foreign rate difference 31 26 26 Change in valuation allowance(1) 6 7 7 Other – net (23) (10) (7) Income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 Effective tax rate 23.9 % 24.8 % 25.0 % (1) Net of changes in related tax attributes.\nThe decrease to the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by increased tax benefits related to stock compensation. Foreign Undistributed Earnings Estimated gross undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $544 million and $530 million, respectively. The Company considers these undistributed earnings permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and is not recording a deferred tax liability for any foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. If at some future date the Company ceases to be permanently reinvested in its foreign subsidiaries, the Company may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on these undistributed earnings and may need to record a deferred tax liability for any outside basis difference in its investments in its foreign subsidiaries. 62 Tax Uncertainties The Company recognizes in the financial statements a provision for tax uncertainties, resulting from application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions. The changes in the liability for tax uncertainties, excluding interest, are as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 41 $ 38 $ 39 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 6 4 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 2 — Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) — (1) Reductions due to statute lapse (3) (2) (3) Settlements, audit payments, refunds – net (2) (1) — Balance at end of year $ 42 $ 41 $ 38 The Company classifies the liability for tax uncertainties in deferred income taxes and tax uncertainties. Included in this amount is $5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Any changes in the timing of deductibility of these items would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authorities to an earlier period. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the changes to tax positions were primarily related to the impact of expiring statutes and current year state and local reserves. The Company is regularly subject to examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service. The statute of limitations expired for the Company's 2019 federal tax return while tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open. The Company is also subject to audit by state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Tax years 2012 through 2022 remain subject to state and local audits and 2012 through 2022 remain subject to foreign audits. The amount of liability associated with the Company's tax uncertainties may change within the next 12 months due to the pending audit activity, expiring statutes or tax payments. A reasonable estimate of such change cannot be made. 63 NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions N.A. and Endless Assortment. The remaining businesses, which includes the Company's Cromwell business, are classified as Other to reconcile to consolidated results. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.\nThe Company's corporate costs are allocated to each reportable segment based on benefits received. Additionally, intersegment sales transactions, which are sales between Grainger businesses in separate reportable segments, are eliminated within the segment to present only the impact of sales to external customers. Service fees for intersegment sales are included in each segment's SG&A and are also eliminated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing is a summary of segment results (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 2021 Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 13,267 $ 2,334 $ 12,182 $ 1,983 $ 10,186 $ 1,334 Endless Assortment 2,916 233 2,787 223 2,576 232 Other 295 (2) 259 9 260 (19) Total Company $ 16,478 $ 2,565 $ 15,228 $ 2,215 $ 13,022 $ 1,547 2023 2022 2021 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense: High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 206 $ 168 $ 148 Endless Assortment 63 35 22 Other 8 3 3 Total $ 277 $ 206 $ 173 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense presented above includes long-lived assets, capitalized software and ROU assets.

Products are regularly added and removed from the Company's inventory. Accordingly, it would be impractical to provide sales information by product category due to the way the business is managed, and the dynamic nature of the inventory offered, including the evolving list of products stocked and additional products available online but not stocked. Assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker. 64 NOTE 14 - CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS From time to time the Company is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, including claims related to: product liability, safety or compliance; privacy and cybersecurity matters; negligence; contract disputes; environmental issues; unclaimed property; wage and hour laws; intellectual property; advertising and marketing; consumer protection; pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes); employment practices; regulatory compliance, including trade and export matters; anti-bribery and corruption; and other matters and actions brought by team members, consumers, competitors, suppliers, customers, governmental entities and other third parties.\nAs previously disclosed, between 2019 and 2021, Grainger, KMCO, LLC (KMCO) and other entities were named as defendants in various personal injury and property damage lawsuits in Harris County, Texas relating to an explosion at a KMCO chemical refinery in Crosby, Texas on April 2, 2019. The Company has since settled several of the personal injury lawsuits, including those alleging the most serious injuries. As previously disclosed, those settlements had no effect on net earnings or cash flows for prior quarters or years. The Company continues to contest the remaining KMCO-related lawsuits. The Company is currently unable to predict the timing, outcome or any estimate of possible loss or range of loss on the KMCO lawsuits. Also, as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local governmental entities, the Company may be subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to contract administration, pricing and product compliance.\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these proceedings and other matters, it believes that their ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nNOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 31, 2024, Grainger's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.86 per share of common stock, payable March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record on February 12, 2024. 65 Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.\nItem 9A: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosures and Controls The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.\nGrainger's management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment under that framework and the criteria established therein, Grainger's management concluded that Grainger's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to Grainger's internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Grainger's internal control over financial reporting. 66 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, W.W Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 67 Item 9B: Other Information None of the Company's directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's quarter ended December 31, 2023.

On one end of the spectrum are small distributors who offer local service but limited technology and geographic reach. On the other end are large suppliers with strong eCommerce platforms and national reach but limited local service. In this landscape, Fastenal stands apart in our ability to support customers with local service, comprehensive technology, and consistent capabilities on a global scale.\nThe goal is to help organizations reduce cost, risk, and growth constraints in their supply chains. The result: an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership for products purchased from Fastenal by an average of 21.2% (learn more on pg. 8).\nThese Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) programs represented 40.3% of total sales in 2023.\n95% of total revenue comes from customers utilizing more than one of our sales channels and tools, with 74% of total revenue coming from customers utilizing four or more.(3) Our local team operates in 3,419 in-market selling locations across 25 countries.\n64% of our $1.5B in inventory is staged locally or within customer sites for same-day access.\n1,597 public branches 1,822 Onsite locations Our local service is enhanced by a variety of technology solutions.\n56.1% of our total revenue flows through this “Digital Footprint.”(1) 113,138 weighted FASTBin/ FASTVend installations (MEUs(2)) MOVING FORWARD IN OUR ESG JOURNEY In the latter part of 2022, we achieved third-party certification to the ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management standard, the ISO/IEC 27001 information security management standard, and the ISO 14001 environmental management standard – all reflecting our core commitment to being a safe, secure, and sustainable organization.\nHaving completed an ESG materiality assessment in late 2022, we began 2023 by road-mapping our ESG strategy and building out our internal ESG Community of Practice to promote structured cross-departmental collaboration. In Q4 2023, we completed a scope 3 materiality assessment to broaden our understanding of our carbon inventory and guide future efforts to reduce our environmental impact.\nAs a result of our efforts and improved reporting on ESG matters, we received the 2023 Sustainability Award from Business Intelligence Group and made Newsweek’s 2024 list of America’s Greenest Companies. We finished the year by being awarded a silver medal from EcoVadis, signifying that our sustainability performance ranks in the top 25% of all companies in all industries assessed by EcoVadis.\nScan below to learn more about our ESG programs and progress.\nFASTVend™ Providing secure access and usage tracking close to the point of use in a customer’s facility.\nFASTBin™ Point-of-use devices with embedded technology providing a 24/7 sightline to the customer’s current inventory state.\nFASTStock SM Using mobile technology to illuminate inventory and simplify replenishment.\neCommerce Improves the efficiency of procurement/purchasing processes.

We have always operated under the premise there is no façade, and we openly share ourselves (warts included). To that end, we started sharing a section from the Blue Team Report, our internal annual report to employees, several years ago. Page three includes the lead-in letter from the current report.\nThe Fastenal culture could be characterized as a “glass half-full” mindset or, stated more directly, a “group of pragmatic optimists.” One of the goals in writing this year’s letter to employees, and in sharing some insight into our January 2024 earnings call, was to remind us of the work we’ve completed and to use this reminder as a means to shed some of the unneeded baggage that may have come along for the ride. Another goal was simply to reset our view towards our opportunity – a big market in need of a great supply chain partner like Fastenal. Shifting gears to our message to you, our valued shareholders, here are three items which were either noted in the earnings call or are relevant to a discussion about 2023 (and beyond). First, our global footprint has evolved. In 2022, our total international business exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In 2023, our international business in just the Americas exceeded $1 billion for the first time. This business is primarily in Canada and Mexico, and it’s operated with locally grown talent. Our international business outside the Americas continues to progress, and today we think of it as a $200-million business poised for the future.\nAt this size, the depth of employee talent is large enough to benefit from an increase in investment. The first step to this increased investment involved splitting our international business into two pieces – Americas (outside the United States) and Eurasia (Europe and Asia). We then elevated two successful international leaders to lead these new business units. Next, we challenged everyone within our supporting infrastructure, which is primarily United States-based, to spend some time traveling internationally and to actively invest more time and attention to helping their “international cousins.” Our international business units represent about 17% of our revenue and should receive at least 17% of our attention. Build for the future!\nSecond, we completed a large-scale multi-year branch optimization initiative in the United States, and to a lesser degree in Canada, which began a decade ago (and which occurred largely unnoticed). As highlighted in our January 2024 earnings call, our United States and Canada branch network peaked in 2013 at just over 2,600 locations. In 2013 and 2014, we had a slight reduction because we weren’t pushing the team to open branches. During this time, we also gained momentum with the expansion of our Onsite locations (the subset of our business dedicated to one customer versus a local market). There was a separate component of our business also gaining momentum: our industrial vending business (a service channel we now refer to as FASTVend, a subset of Fastenal Managed Inventory, or FMI). Since 2015, our local sales leadership actively contracted their branch network. To assist, we provided our district managers with a 10,000-foot view of the marketplace. (As noted, much of the reduction occurred in the United States. This subset represented about 2,400 of our 2,600 United States and Canadian locations a decade ago.) At our peak United States branch count, we estimate we were within a 30-minute drive of about 95% of the United States manufacturing marketplace. At today’s count of 1,441, we believe we still have 30-minute access to roughly 93.5% of the U.S. manufacturing marketplace (with a similar presence in Canada) based on our prior analysis of a target branch count of 1,450. The contraction lowered our occupancy expense in the field and was a necessary part of our Onsite expansion; however, the work of consolidating and relocating also distracted our local team. It’s nice to have this distraction behind us.\nThe branch optimization initiative was a major undertaking, but we believe the most significant change of the last decade is our expanded Onsite location network. (See the chart on the following page, which was previously provided in our January 2024 earnings call flip book.) The best way to think of our Onsite network is a business model adaptation that enhances our ability to pursue the total addressable market. In full disclosure, the Onsite network encompasses three main variations: (1) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in the customer’s facility, (2) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in a facility located near the customer site, or (3) a dedicated business unit primarily located in the back of an existing Fastenal branch. The latter two types are usually a result of a customer’s lack of space for us in their facility. We prefer option one but will adjust to any of the three.\nThe evolution of our branch and Onsite network unlocks our energy to pursue by freeing up time for greater engagement with our customers. It also allows us to lower our cost structure. The former is about inquiry and customer service, and the latter is about expanding the basket of products (or customer needs) available to us based on situational economics. (The operational efficiency of the Onsite model allows us to do and supply things for our customers that traditionally would not have been cost-effective.) Here is an example of the impact based on four of our oldest markets (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois). These four U.S. states represented about 19% of our global revenue in 2007 (our 40th year as a business). From 2007 to 2017, our revenue in this geography had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%, and our pre-tax earnings had a CAGR of 5.6%. In 2023, these four American states represented about 15% of our global revenue; and from 2017 to 2023, this revenue expanded to a CAGR of 8.2%, while our pre-tax earnings expanded to an 8.5% CAGR. Simply put, our local team enhanced our ability to grow in a very mature market by changing their approach. Part of the change involved reducing the number of branch locations in these four states by almost 30% versus a decade ago while expanding the Onsite location count roughly seven-fold. In these four states, our Onsite business grew from about 18% of revenue to about 46%. If we want to be more wonky on the view and look at our six oldest metropolitan markets touching these four states (Minneapolis, Madison, Milwaukee, Omaha, Des Moines, and Chicago), a similar story emerges. The branch count drop is slightly greater than 30%, and the Onsite count expansion is more pronounced, with a greater than 10-fold increase. Similarly, our CAGR for revenue and pre-tax earnings expanded, and the percent of our business operated through an Onsite expanded.\nTHANK YOU For Being a Shareholder of Fastenal Dan Florness President & Chief Executive Officer 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 1 Again, the details are a little wonky, but the point is simple: The Blue Team in these markets challenged the status quo, redefined their approach, and improved an already-great business. I believe this enhances our future potential in every market in which we operate. Time will demonstrate if this belief is correct.\nThe third and final item is our operating cash flow – i.e., the Net cash provided by operating activities line in our cash flow statement (and the ultimate health of a business’ long-term potential). The improvement to operating cash flow we enjoyed in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in 2023. For background, during 2021 and most of 2022, we dramatically increased our inventory to support our customers in a period plagued by global supply bottlenecks. As conditions started to improve in late 2022, we started to unwind this inventory expansion. Given the cash flow dynamics of a distribution business, this unwind dramatically improved our operating cash flow.\nThis cash belongs to you – thank you for giving us the opportunity to use it over the last several years to support our customers. The cash was sent to you in the form of a supplemental dividend paid in December 2023, the fourth such supplemental dividend in our history. (The other three were explained in greater detail in last year’s letter to shareholders.) Rest assured, this supplemental dividend is a statement about confidence in the business, not about opportunities to invest.\nWe believe our ability to generate cash in the future, and our ability to supplement available cash with debt if needed (given our conservative balance sheet), will allow us to invest in opportunities as we continue our pursuit of Growth Through Customer Service.\nGood luck in 2024, and thank you for your belief in the Blue Team at Fastenal.\nGo Blue!\nDANIEL L.

Come to think of it, Bob Kierlin already did – it’s titled The Power of Fastenal People. It’s an interesting read, and I would highly recommend it. Even if you’ve read it before, a refresher never hurts. To be honest, every employee in Fastenal (me included) would have been well served to have read it in 2022 and in 2023. It would have reminded us how important it is to (1) support each other and (2) stay focused on our common goal. As it turned out, we wavered on both fronts, and as a result, we underperformed in both years.\nIt wasn’t as obvious in 2022. The global economy was mending from the pandemic, supply chains were constrained, and inflation was running hot. Our strength in supply chain really shined through, and we grew well; however, under the surface we knew we were losing something. We started to forget about our priorities and purpose, and we became a bit too focused on ourselves. As 2023 progressed, it became apparent, and then a weaker global marketplace amplified the problem.\nThere’s a quote credited to Winston Churchill from the World War II era, and it goes something like this: “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.” I’m not sure why this quote popped into my head, but it seemed to aptly describe the Blue Team’s approach to 2023. The good news: After some soul searching and structural changes, we’ve progressed from “tried everything else” to “do the right thing,” which for us means refocusing on our core strengths as an organization.\nFastenal has a superpower. I believe the essence of this power can be summarized as our ability to find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. In an era when it’s easy to find differences and separation, we excel at the opposite, and the members of the Blue Team cherish the unique humanness in each other. We also care enough to push each other to learn, to change, and to grow; and this creates a winning culture. Yes, we sometimes drive each other crazy with our speed of change, but that’s okay – our customers like this about us. We harness this superpower every day by remembering some simple truths: 1. Get everyone pursuing a common goal and you can accomplish great things. 2. Understand our obligations to each other.\n3. Goals matter!\nThe first truth is about our desire to deliver great customer service, knowing the market’s reward for this service is growth. As alluded to above, we lost sight of this truth in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, our common goal is serving the customer well. Fortunately, our motto is easy to remember: Growth Through Customer Service.\nThe second truth is understanding our obligations to each other. We directly serve our customers through the local Blue Team in our branch and Onsite network. Everyone else provides the assist by focusing on helping the local Blue Team. This keeps it simple, and we find success together.\nIf you listen to our quarterly earnings calls, you might have been taken aback by the bluntness in our January 18th call. Don’t get me wrong, we provided some context by discussing the weak economy: 14 consecutive months of economic contraction in the manufacturing sector, as indicated by a sub-50 Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), the longest period of contraction since the Great Recession. But we spent more time discussing our poor execution and the steps taken to address the problem.\nOn this and on earlier calls we spoke about some needed course corrections, and about asking some people to step into new roles. We also spoke about the positives – our success with FMI, our celebration of 20 years in China (and my recent visit to the Blue Team there to recognize the milestone), and our upcoming ten-year celebration in India. If the schedule works out, I hope to visit our Blue Team in India later this year.\nSpeaking of new roles, Jeff Watts (who was promoted to chief sales officer in 2023) laid out three simple concepts for 2024 when he spoke at our recent Employee Expo: (1) Alignment – working together toward a common goal, (2) Accountability – embracing a culture of ownership, and (3) Execution – translating plans into action. The concepts are simple and direct.\nAs we move into 2024, I’m excited by what I see: We are focused on our strength: driving planned/managed spend. We are acknowledging and addressing our deficiencies: improving our capabilities around unplanned/unmanaged spend. This includes addressing weakness in our eCommerce capabilities and creating PO automation to simplify daily processes. We’re also improving our knowledge capabilities (i.e., IT/data capabilities) to view our business through a holistic “customer” lens versus an individual “account” lens. We have a clear sales focus: Target 5, Onsite growth, FMI, and the Customer Solutions Consultant (CSC) program. We’ve also simplified the language we use to describe our diverse customer base: “contract” and “non-contract” customers.\nEarlier I mentioned a recent trip to China (so recent I’m still experiencing a bit of jet lag). There were many highlights from the trip – meeting the team in person, seeing their facilities and how they support their local customers and their Blue Team cousins across the globe, spending time with a long-term supplier. However, what stood out to me is the number of people recognized for five, ten, fifteen, and twenty years of service. We are still a very young organization in China, and it’s amazing how many people have decided to make Fastenal a career.\nAs always, good luck in 2024 … and GO BLUE!\nDANIEL L.

Approximately 36 years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split eight times, had become 192,000 shares worth $12,435,840, for a gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $2,285,664 in dividends since August 20, 1987, for a total gain of approximately 22.8% compounded annually.\nTen Years On December 31, 2013, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $47,500. Ten years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 10.6% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $18,960 in dividends since December 2013, for a total gain of approximately 12.1% compounded annually.\nFive Years On December 31, 2018, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $52,300. Five years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 19.9% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $12,820 in dividends since December 2018, for a total gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually.\nDividends We have paid dividends in every year since 1991, and quarterly dividends since 2011. In addition, Fastenal paid a special one-time dividend during December 2023, 2020, 2012, and 2008.\nA Simple Philosophy Since going public in 1987, we have maintained a consistent focus on avoiding, if feasible, the potentially dilutive impact of our activities on our shareholders. To this end, we have grown our organization principally with internal cash flow, have supported the Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan with stock purchased in the open market, and, since creating a stock option program in 2003, have periodically purchased common stock in the open market to, among other things, offset the potential impact of our stock option grants. We have purchased approximately 54.4 million shares since 2003 and have granted our employees options to purchase approximately 32.4 million shares. (Note: These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of stock splits.) This has allowed us to balance internal investment with cash returns to shareholders. For example, in the last five years we have enjoyed total sales of $31,319 million and total pre-tax earnings of $6,346 million. During this same time period, we spent approximately $5,636 million to compensate a group of great employees, we supported our customers’ needs by adding approximately $617 million in operational working capital assets (accounts receivable, net, plus inventory) and by spending approximately $869 million in net capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds of sales), and we returned $3,964 million to our shareholders. The latter was principally through dividends (approximately $3,674 million), with the remainder through share purchases. A final point worth noting: We are an important element of the tax base in the many communities in which we operate. During the last five years, we have incurred approximately $1,529 million in income taxes, or approximately 24.1% of the pre-tax earnings noted above, and incurred or remitted approximately $1,465 million in employment taxes, $68 million in property taxes, $1,023 million in sales, use, and value-added taxes, and $5 million in other miscellaneous business-related taxes. This adds up to a total of approximately $4.1 billion in taxes funded in our communities.\n1,000 shares ($9,000) invested on August 20, 1987 Value on December 31, 2023: $12,435,840 Stock Split Stock Performance Highlights (1), (2) 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 7 CREATING VALUE AND MEASURING THE IMPACT Average TCO Savings Opportunity* This is the high-level finding of a study of 445 vetted TCO Analysis exercises.\nBelow is a look at some of the drivers behind this headline number.\n21.2% 39% average reduction in inventory carrying cost 61% average reduction in cost associated with material handling/distribution 32% average reduction in transportation cost 56% average vendor reduction 36% average reduction in employee travel time 47% average reduction in the cost to source products 20% average consumption reduction through vending Accepted industry average (not based on our internal study) Fastenal’s solution-based approach stems from a simple truth: Every minute or dollar our customers spend procuring, managing, owning, or accessing supplies is a minute or dollar they aren’t spending on value-creating activities. Our job is to help them minimize those sources of waste, and it often starts with a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis. This includes (1) mapping how products are procured, moved, staged, and used in their facilities; (2) quantifying the costs surrounding those activities; and (3) presenting a tailored set of solutions to help them achieve specific TCO reduction goals for the products in scope. * This average TCO savings opportunity is based on an assumption of the customers’ full adoption of our suggested services and solutions. Vetted opportunities meet the following criteria: (1) the conductor of the TCO Analysis (a trained Fastenal Lean Six Sigma specialist) has confirmed the validity of the data entered; (2) 70% or more of the TCO Analysis data is customer-specific, not based on industry averages; and (3) the data was accepted/agreed upon by the customer during or after the TCO Analysis presentation.\nThe takeaway: By helping customers operate more efficiently and productively, our role is elevated from “supplier of products” to “strategic partner in the business.” This focus on value creation and documentation allows us to build exceptionally strong relationships, maintain resilient revenue streams, and widen our competitive moat.\n8 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 10-K (Mark One) ☒ Annual report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or ☐ Transition report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the transition period from to Commission file number 0-16125 FASTENAL COMPANY (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Minnesota 41-0948415 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization) (I.R.S.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other reports of the company and other written and oral statements made from time to time by the company, do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. As such, they are considered 'forward-looking statements' that provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, may, will, plan, goal, project, hope, trend, target, opportunity, and similar words or expressions, or by references to typical outcomes. Any statement that is not a purely historical fact, including estimates, projections, trends, and the outcome of events that have not yet occurred, is a forward-looking statement. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our expectations regarding the business environment in which we operate, our projections of future performance and opportunities for growth based on potential market opportunities, our perceived marketplace opportunities, our strategies, goals, mission and vision, and our expectations about matters including capital expenditures, tax rates, inventory levels, liquidity, liabilities from tax positions, the performance of our fastener business in comparison to our non-fastener business, openings and closing of in-market locations and signings of Onsite locations and new machine equivalent units for Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) (including bin stock and industrial vending) and the competitive advantages they offer, our digital solutions and other product offerings (including new product lines), national accounts as a percentage of overall sales, the advantages of our integrated physical and virtual model, growth in safety products as a percentage of product sales, the amount of FMI revenue that we may be able to service through local inventory fulfillment terminals, and the ability of our competitors to replicate our distribution capabilities. You should understand that forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, economic downturns (including economic downturns as a result of global pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic), weakness in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, competitive pressure on selling prices, changes in trade policies or tariffs, changes in our current mix of products, customers, or geographic locations, changes in our average branch size, changes in our purchasing patterns, changes in customer needs, changes in fuel or commodity prices, product and transportation inflation, inclement weather, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, difficulty in adapting our business model to different foreign business environments, failure to accurately predict the market potential of our business strategies, the introduction or expansion of new business strategies, increased competition (including with respect to our FMI or Onsite operations), difficulty in maintaining installation quality as our industrial vending business expands, the failure to meet our goals and expectations regarding expansion of our FMI or Onsite operations or any changes in branch locations, changes in the implementation objectives of our business strategies, difficulty in hiring, relocating, training, or retaining qualified personnel, difficulty in controlling operating expenses, difficulty in collecting receivables or accurately predicting future inventory needs, changes in sales trends, changes in supplier production lead times, changes in our cash position or our need to make capital expenditures, credit market volatility and increases in interest rates, changes in tax law or the impact of discrete items on future tax rates, changes in the availability or price of commercial real estate, changes in the nature, price, or availability of distribution, supply chain, or other technology (including software licensed from third parties) and services related to that technology, difficulty in obtaining continued business from new safety product customers and the acceptance by customers of any new product lines, cyber security incidents, potential liability and reputational damage that can arise if our products are defective, and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10-K under the heading 'Item 1A. Risk Factors'. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date.\nPRESENTATION OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS All dollar amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in millions, except for share and per share amounts or where otherwise noted. Throughout this document, percentage and dollar change calculations, which are based on non-rounded dollar values, may not be able to be recalculated using the dollar values in this document due to the rounding of those dollar values.

The year end is December 31, 2023 unless additional years are included or noted.\nOverview Fastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as 'Fastenal' or the company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population today of approximately 26,000. We began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small, medium, and, in subsequent years, large cities. Over time, how and where we engage our customers has expanded and evolved. Today we sell a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines through a global network of in-market locations utilizing diverse technologies such as vending devices, bin stock devices, and eCommerce. The large majority of our transactions are business-to-business. We provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document. At the end of 2023, we had 3,419 in-market locations (defined in the table below) in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in North America (12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico), and two in Europe, and we employed 23,201 people. We believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers, and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement.\nOur Channels to Market We engage our customers primarily through branch and Onsite locations. Branches and Onsites exist very close to our customers, usually within miles in the case of the former and most often within or immediately proximate to our customers' physical locations in the case of the latter, and together constitute our 'in-market' network. Many of our customers engage with us through eCommerce, but in most cases these customers are utilizing eCommerce to supplement our service through our other channels.\nThe following table shows, as of the end of each of the last 10 fiscal years, our consolidated net sales; the number of branch, Onsite, and total in-market locations; their respective sales, as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and Onsite locations; and our revenue generated from non-traditional sources: 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 6,010.9 5,647.3 5,333.7 4,965.1 4,390.5 3,962.0 3,869.2 3,733.5 Branch locations 1,597 1,683 1,793 2,003 2,114 2,227 2,383 2,503 2,622 2,637 Branch revenue (1) $ 4,073.6 4,161.6 3,726.2 3,587.1 3,660.1 3,625.8 3,399.6 3,198.1 3,281.8 3,225.3 Average monthly sales per branch location (2) $ 207.0 199.5 163.6 145.2 140.5 131.1 116.0 104.0 104.0 101.0 Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 1,416 1,265 1,114 894 605 401 264 214 Onsite revenue (1) $ 2,926.7 2,465.5 1,898.0 1,485.6 1,391.7 1,081.7 770.2 569.2 454.3 387.7 Average monthly sales per Onsite location (2) $ 141.6 135.2 118.0 104.1 115.5 120.3 127.6 142.7 158.4 157.6 Other revenue (3) $ 346.4 353.5 386.7 574.6 281.9 257.6 220.7 194.7 133.1 120.5 Total in-market locations (4) 3,419 3,306 3,209 3,268 3,228 3,121 2,988 2,904 2,886 2,851 (1) Revenues attributable to our traditional and international branch locations (both of which are defined below), and our Onsite locations, respectively.\n(2) Average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and Onsites, respectively, in the given year, factoring in the beginning and ending location count, divided by total revenues attributable to our branch and Onsite locations, respectively, further divided by 12 months. This information is presented in thousands.\n(3) This portion of revenue is generated outside our traditional in-market locations, examples of which include revenues arising from our custom in-house manufacturing, industrial services, and other non-traditional sources of revenue. In 2020, this included the effects of COVID-19, one response to which was substantial sales of pandemic-related products that were direct-shipped (versus sold through in-market locations) as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly.\n(4) 'In-market locations' is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of Onsite locations.\n2 This structure has evolved over time as a result of one of Fastenal's guiding principles since inception: that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer. This has been achieved by opening branch locations and, more recently, Onsite locations. Today, we believe there are few companies that offer our North American in-market location coverage. In 2023, roughly 52% of our sales and 51% of our in-market locations were in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (populations in the United States and Canada greater than 500,000 people), while 21% of our sales and 19% of our in-market locations were in small MSAs (populations under 500,000 people), and 27% of our sales and 30% of our in-market locations were not in an MSA. In our view, this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis. Maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers' operations have represented, and continue to represent, the foundation of our service approach. We have two primary versions of our branch locations: 1) A 'traditional branch' typically services a wide variety of customers, ranging from the local operations of large, national account customers to smaller local businesses. Based on the unique characteristics of certain markets, some traditional branches will be structured and stocked to service retail customers. Locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network and employment and production data for manufacturing and non-residential construction companies. We stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and tailored by our district and branch personnel to the needs of the local customer base. Since Fastenal's founding and through 2013, traditional branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company, and we experienced net openings each year over that time span. However, new growth drivers, business models, and business tools have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth. Traditional branches were entirely U.S.-based until 1994, when we opened our first location in Canada. At the end of 2023, we had 1,441 traditional branches in the United States and Canada, and they represented 51.0% of net sales.\nTraditional branches are also differentiated by their operating styles. Certain locations are Customer Service Branches (CSBs), which tend to feature a showroom and our standard stocking model of products designed for contractors. CSBs often conduct some business with non-account or retail-like customers. However, this customer set typically represents less than 10% of sales at this type of location. Other locations operate as Customer Fulfillment Centers (CFCs), which tend to feature a limited showroom and stock customer-specific inventory. These tend to appear and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location and often have fewer transactions with non-account or retail-like customers than in a CSB branch. The choice of operating style is made by local leadership and is based on local market considerations. At the end of 2023, 15% of our traditional branches operated as a CSB and 85% operated as a CFC.\n2) An 'international branch' is the format we typically deploy outside the United States and Canada. We first expanded outside of the United States and Canada when we opened a branch in Mexico in 2001. Since then, we have continued to expand our global footprint, and at the end of 2023, we operated in 23 countries outside of the United States and Canada. Mexico is the largest of these, and we also operate in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Our go-to-market strategy in countries outside of the United States and Canada focuses primarily on servicing large, national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing and heavily oriented toward planned fastener and non-fastener product spend. We are not as well recognized in many of our non-North American locations as we are in the U.S. and Canada. However, our ability to provide a consistent service model, including vending, bin stocks, and Onsites, on a global basis is attractive to our customer base, much of which are the foreign operations of North American-based companies. At the end of 2023, we had 156 international branches operating outside the U.S. and Canada, and they represented 4.5% of net sales.\nTraditional and international branches sell to multiple customers. In each year since 2013, we have experienced a net decline in our total branch count, primarily due to consolidations in our U.S. market, including net declines of 86 branches in 2023. Our total decline since 2013 is 1,090 branches. We will continue to open traditional and international branches in accordance with our overall strategy. We believe the strategic rationalization that has produced a significant decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. Onsite locations may influence the trend in our traditional branch count over time, but have not been the primary reason for our traditional branch closings. The Onsite concept is not new, in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992. However, it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014. We have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015. In this model, we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within, or strategically proximate to, the customers' facility, with inventory that is specific to the customers' needs. In many cases, we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch location, though we also see new customer opportunities arise as a result of our Onsite capabilities. The model is best suited for larger companies, though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors. It has been our experience that the sales mix at our Onsite locations typically produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations, but we gain revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is lower. We have identified over 12,000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in North America with potential to implement the Onsite service model. These include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today, and 3 potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today. However, as awareness of our capabilities has grown, we have identified additional Onsite potential with certain agencies of state, provincial, and local government customers, and academia. We also believe as we follow our existing national account customers outside the United States, our market potential for Onsite solutions will continue to expand. The international opportunity is substantial, but our speed is limited by our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the United States. We expect revenues from Onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time. We had 1,822 Onsite locations as of December 31, 2023, which represented 39.8% of net sales, and signed 326, 356, and 274 new Onsite locations (referred to herein as signings) in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the branches and Onsite locations we operated at the end of each year, as well as the openings, closings, and conversions during each year: North America Outside North America United States (1) Canada Mexico Subtotal Central & South America (2) Asia (3) Europe (4) Subtotal Total In-Market Locations - 12/31/21 (5) 2,668 262 152 3,082 20 37 70 127 3,209 Starting Branches 1,484 173 63 1,720 5 20 48 73 1,793 Opened Branches — 1 4 5 — 2 5 7 12 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (115) (5) (1) (121) — — (1) (1) (122) Ending Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Starting Onsites 1,184 89 89 1,362 15 17 22 54 1,416 Opened Onsites 248 21 23 292 1 6 7 14 306 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (94) (3) (1) (98) — — (1) (1) (99) Ending Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 In-Market Locations - 12/31/22 2,707 276 177 3,160 21 45 80 146 3,306 Starting Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Opened Branches — — 3 3 — 3 4 7 10 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (92) (5) — (97) — — 1 1 (96) Ending Branches 1,277 164 69 1,510 5 25 57 87 1,597 Starting Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 Opened Onsites 283 18 20 321 — 1 7 8 329 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (115) (6) (3) (124) (1) (2) (3) (6) (130) Ending Onsites 1,506 119 128 1,753 15 22 32 69 1,822 In-Market Locations - 12/31/23 2,783 283 197 3,263 20 47 89 156 3,419 (1) Includes the United States, the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n(2) Includes Panama, Brazil, and Chile.\n(3) Includes Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n(4) Includes the Netherlands, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, France, and Belgium.\n(5) Beginning in 2022, the United States includes the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico which were previously grouped with other geographical regions. Prior period figures in the above table may differ slightly from those previously disclosed due to this minor change in reporting. (6) The net impact of non-in-market locations or Onsite locations converted to branches, branches converted to Onsite locations or non-in-market locations, and closures of branches or Onsite locations.\nWe believe the profitability of our in-market locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site. In any in-market location, certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable, such as employee-related expenses, while others, like rent and utility costs, tend to be fixed. As a result, it has been shown that as an in-market location increases its sales base over time, it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin. This ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by: (1) general growth based on end market expansion and/or market share gains, (2) the age of the in-market location (new locations tend to be less profitable due to start-up costs and, in the case of a traditional branch, the time necessary to generate a customer base), and/or (3) rationalization actions, as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional 4 branch base. There are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location. Key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market, factories may have closed, our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches, and/or our customers may have transitioned to our Onsite model. An Onsite location may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise, in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local traditional branch. The paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an Onsite location, as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage, while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employee-related expenses. In the short term, the Onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged.\nWe utilize additional types of selling locations within our network, but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number, comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations. We remain committed to a large, robust service network, including traditional branches, international branches, and Onsites; it remains the indispensable foundation of our business. With the growth we anticipate in Onsite locations, we believe our total in-market locations will increase further over time.\nOur Business Tools Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) Over time, we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location, increase the visibility of a customer's supply chain (to the customer as well as our personnel), and/or improve the ability to monitor or control usage. While there are isolated exceptions, these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and Onsite channels to enhance service to our customers. Collectively, these tools comprise our Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) Technology suite. We believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers. FMI programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and, coupled with our fully integrated distribution network, foster a strong relationship with customers.\nBin stock (FASTStock℠ and FASTBin®) programs, where product is held in bins in a customer facility, are similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities. Such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time, with open bins being clustered in a racking system, each of which holds original equipment manufacturing (OEM) fasteners, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) fasteners, and/ or non-fastener products that are consumed in the customers' operations. Historically, these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or Fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need. These bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customized digital plan-o-grams, which we call FASTStock and allow for the scanning of product when it is at a minimum desired level. However, in 2019 we introduced our FASTBin technology. FASTBin is the evolution of FASTStock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 24/7 continuous inventory monitoring, real-time inventory visibility, and more efficient replenishment of bin stock parts. These technologies come in three forms: (1) scales that utilize a high-precision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum; (2) infrared (IR) that uses infrared sensors lining individual bins to provide real-time visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum threshold; and (3) RFID, which is a Kanban system that utilizes RFID tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone (also part of the same racking system), a notification is sent to Fastenal to refill the order. These technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes, allowing for a lean supply chain, reducing risk of stock-outs, and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier.\nIndustrial vending (FASTVend®) was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control. Benefits include reduced consumption, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability. We believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive in-market network of inventory and local personnel. For these reasons, the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011, and we finished 2023 with approximately 111,800 FASTVend non-weighted devices in the field. We believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized. We also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base of devices before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support. We estimate the market could support as many as 1.7 million vending units and, as a result, we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time.\n5 Our industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices, with 16 of these being in either a helix or locker format. Our most utilized models include the helix-based FAST 5000 and our 12- and 18-door lockers; combined, these comprise approximately 66% of our installed base of devices. These are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers. Target monthly revenues per device typically range from under $1,000 to in excess of $3,000, with our flagship FAST 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of $2,000. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we began to report a weighted FMI measure which combines the signings and installations of FASTBin and FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We do not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins, shelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. This conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each FMI device signed or installed and compares it to the $2,000 target monthly throughput of our FAST 5000 vending device. For example, an RFID enclosure, with target monthly revenue of $2,000 would be counted as '1.00' machine equivalent ($2,000/$2,000 = 1.00). An infrared bin, with target monthly revenue of $40, would be counted as '0.02' machine equivalent ($40/$2,000 = 0.02).\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Change Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs) 24,126 20,735 16.4% Signings per day 95 82 Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period) 113,138 102,151 10.8% FASTStock sales $ 927.6 832.0 11.5% % of sales 12.5% 11.8% FASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 2,070.2 1,755.3 17.9% % of sales 27.8% 24.9% FMI sales $ 2,997.8 2,587.3 15.9% FMI daily sales $ 11.8 10.2 16.3% % of sales 40.3% 36.7% Digital Solutions We also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers, leverage local inventory for same-day solutions, and provide efficient service. While there is a transactional element to our digital services, many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain. These solutions take many forms: 1) Transactional. Our transactional, or eCommerce, platforms (web verticals or integrated catalogs) provide a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure MRO and unplanned spend. While there is a retail component to our transactional digital services, most of the revenue attributable to this is with our traditional customer base, nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools that it utilizes with Fastenal. We attribute the revenue generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the in-market location that traditionally services that customer location. 2) Digital Visibility. Certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves and/or to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chain operations. For instance, we have developed, and continue to develop, 'Mobility' applications, one example of which is our Vending App, which provides a number of benefits. It provides easy, real-time information pertaining to a customer's local inventory position within their point-of-use devices. It incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices, which improves customer inventories while reducing the risk of stock-outs. Moving our fulfillment process from a vending device-based keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process (reduced risk of product outages), reducing time consumed (greater efficiency) while improving accuracy (improved quality assurance). We will continue to build out our suite of Mobility applications. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), is the connectivity between our system and our customers' procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system or through a third-party procurement network or marketplace. These solutions provide a system-to-system exchange of electronic procurement documents (such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices for direct and indirect spend). Our eProcurement Solutions provide a bridge between our FMI replenishment activity and our customers' procurement systems – creating an efficient, accurate and streamlined procure-to-pay (P2P) process. FAST360° acts as the bridge between our FMI footprint and a 6 customer's view into our managed service model. FAST360° surfaces data around these managed services as one central source of information as we manage our customers' OEM and MRO product lines. This is achieved through our FMI technologies providing locational data around our FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend footprint, and FAST360° being the means of surfacing that data and activities to our customers. 3) Analytics. We provide solutions-based digital platforms (e.g., web verticals or integrated catalogs) which leverage our existing strategic environment by creating a means of migrating online spend offline, which illuminates our supply chain capabilities. This is marketed under the FAST360° Analytics label, as it is an enterprise-centric extension of the digital visibility capabilities of FAST360°. We bring value to our customers, as well as ourselves, by using these digital platforms and analytics to shift product from a 'non-sticky' transactional environment (which is online) to a 'sticky' strategic environment (which is our FMI programs). We create customer cost savings opportunities through this directive by lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) as the objective is to shrink the unplanned (and traditionally high cost), purely transactional spend bucket.\nDigital Footprint Our digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that proportion of our eCommerce sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both ourselves and our customers. As a result, we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities. Our Digital Footprint represented 56.1% of sales in 2023.\nWe believe our integrated physical and virtual model, when paired with our national (and increasingly international) scope, represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to eCommerce as an independent sales channel. We expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time. Our greatest opportunity lies with the deployment of efficient and effective supply chain programs. We are focused on addressing the four key components of people, products, processes, and technology to support this model. We believe our global channels to market and business tools, including those that we consider to be growth drivers (Onsites, international expansion, FMI, and digital solutions), represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups. These means get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed. This is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and 'sticky' service. Combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling (in-market and otherwise) and non-selling (engineering, product specialists, manufacturing, etc.) employees, we offer a range of capabilities that are difficult for large and small competitors to replicate.\nDistribution Network We operate 15 regional distribution centers in North America: 12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico. We also operate two distribution centers in Europe. These distribution centers give us approximately 5.0 million square feet of distribution capacity. Additional details on these locations can be found within the 'Item 2. Properties' section of this Form 10-K. These distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our in-market locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier, with approximately 74% of our North American in-market locations receiving service four to five times per week. The distribution centers in Indiana and Kansas also serve as 'master' hubs, with those in California and North Carolina serving as 'secondary' hubs to support the needs of the in-market locations in their geographic regions as well as to provide a broader selection of products for the in-market locations serviced by the other distribution centers. We currently operate 11 of our North American distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency, and currently handle approximately 94% of our picking activity. We expect to invest in additional automation technologies, expand existing distribution facilities, and/or add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our in-market locations increases.\n7 We also utilize a network of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) which reside within our existing distribution centers and are intended to support areas that have a dense population of FMI devices. Traditionally, branch personnel were solely responsible for stocking and packaging inventory, delivering to a customer's location, and refilling the customer's devices. As our sales through FMI devices have grown, this approach has resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnel's time being spent on non-sales activities. We primarily utilize a 'drop-and-deliver' model wherein a LIFT is responsible for stocking and packaging FMI supplies, producing inventory and accuracy benefits, and delivering them to the business unit, where delivery and replenishment is then performed by local district or branch personnel. In a minority of cases we deploy a 'drop-and-scatter' model, wherein delivery and replenishment is also performed by LIFT personnel. In 2023, approximately 8% of our FMI revenue was serviced through a LIFT, but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40% of our FMI revenue.\nTransportation The ability to move product, globally and domestically, from our sources of supply to our customers is critical to the competitiveness of our business model. We utilize multiple modes of transportation to support our business model.\nWe transport product from our global manufacturing and supplier partners to our distribution centers. Related costs range from port fees, duties, costs related to container and shipper services, and inland trucking and intermodal charges. We consider these expenses to be a part of our landed product cost, and significant fluctuations are typically addressed through product pricing.\nWe transport product between our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our in-market locations. We typically transport approximately 90% of our products on our own fleet of Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks, with the remainder being on third party shippers. Costs range from lease charges, driver pay, fuel costs to support our captive fleet, and fees paid to third-party shippers. These expenses are included in cost of goods sold but are not considered a part of our landed product cost, with fluctuations typically addressed by applying freight charges to customer purchases and by securing commercial back-hauls. We primarily lease our trucks, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 520 units.\nWe transport product from our in-market locations to our customers on a fleet of pick-up, box, and other trucks. Expenses to maintain this fleet are considered selling-related transportation costs, which include lease charges, depreciation, and fuel, and are typically reflected in all other operating and administrative expenses. We have a mix of leased and owned vehicles, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 10,200 units. Information Systems Our Information Systems teams develop, implement, secure, and maintain the computer-based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, digital, distribution center, and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations, while each selling location uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of custom in-house developed, purchased, and subscription licensed software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.\nTrademarks and Service Marks We conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and taglines in connection with each of these marks, including Where Industry Meets Innovation™. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the 'Fastenal' name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, various trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the United States as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.\nProducts Fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies. This includes threaded fasteners, bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers, as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as pins, machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories. Our fastener product line, which is primarily sold under the Fastenal product name, represented 32.4% of our consolidated sales in 2023. Fastener distribution is complex. In most cases, the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight. This presents challenges in moving product from suppliers, most of whom are outside of North America, to our distribution centers, as well as from our distribution centers to our branch, Onsite, and customer locations. At the same time, fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products, construction projects, and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application. In many cases, a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime and/or effective use. These features have greatly influenced our logistical development, training and educational programs, support capabilities, and inventory decisions, which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate.\n8 In 1993, we began to aggressively add additional product lines, and these represented 67.6% of our consolidated sales in 2023. These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending. The most significant category of non-fastener products is our safety supplies product line, which accounted for 21.2% of our consolidated sales in 2023. This product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last 10 years, which we believe is directly attributable to our success cross-selling safety supplies to customers that utilize us for non-safety products as well as our ability to market, deploy, and service industrial vending over that period. We expect these variables to remain the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line. We plan to continue to add other product lines in the future.\nIn the last several decades, we have added 'private label' brands (often referred to as 'Exclusive Brands', or brands sold exclusively through Fastenal) to our non-fastener offering. Prior to 2023, each of our product categories tended to have its own private label. In 2023, we consolidated these into two labels: Body Guard®, which is our long-standing brand for North American safety supplies, and ORMADUS®, which is our global brand encompassing the remainder of our product offerings. These private label brands represented approximately 13% of our consolidated sales in 2023. We believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 19% of our total non-fastener sales in 2023. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices. Detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K. Each product line may contain multiple product categories. Inventory Control Our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, by our district and regional leadership, and by our product development team. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 64% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 36% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations In 2023, approximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome®, Cardinal Fasteners®, and Spensall® product lines. The services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\n9 Sources of Supply We use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. During 2023, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products, our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. Approximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses fabricated products, heavy machinery, petrochemical, mining and aerospace and includes both OEM and MRO customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation (transportation services, such as air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as fulfillment centers) and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other, interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of revenue tends to be impacted by cyclical changes, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nOur national accounts program is aimed at creating contractual agreements with single or multi-location customers. These contractual programs are intended to help improve our customers' supply chains by identifying productivity and efficiency gains throughout their organization. The scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that these companies need to manage is very complex and costly. We believe that our broad product offering coupled with our ability to execute and curate a dedicated service model for each of their sites provides us with a unique advantage and allows us to provide them with a total cost of ownership benefit. Additionally, our local presence as part of a national, and increasingly international, footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. We believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands. As a result, in 2023, national accounts represented 60.3% of our consolidated sales, compared to 57.8% and 56.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales over time. In an in-market location, we track our customers' business activity through 'active accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2023, we averaged 105,448 active accounts per month and approximately 99.4% of the sales in our in-market locations are derived from our active accounts (the remainder was from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers). Traditionally, our in-market locations, particularly our traditional and international branches, prioritized acquiring additional active accounts and expanding the products and services sold to new and existing active accounts as a means of growing sales. Over time it became clear that the pursuit of smaller accounts consumed significant organizational energy and the large majority of new active accounts did not meaningfully increase in size. Further, the development of our web capabilities provided us with an alternative means of more efficiently servicing these smaller customers. Since 2020, our in-market locations have sought to shift our smallest customers to our web channel while shifting 10 their selling focus to 'key accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key account customers have typically been able to utilize a wider range of our products and services, and as a result have exhibited greater potential to increase in size while being more efficient to pursue and support. In 2023, we averaged 39,266 key accounts per month and approximately 92.4% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Active Accounts 105,448 119,583 130,020 137,380 152,491 156,069 156,464 Key Accounts 39,266 39,151 36,190 33,794 34,621 32,895 30,040 During 2023, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nDirect marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local in-market selling personnel, as well as our non-branch selling personnel. We support our sales team with multi-channel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing, print and radio advertising, targeted campaigns, promotional flyers, and events. In recent years, our national advertising has been focused on a NASCAR® sponsorship through our partnership with Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing® as the primary sponsor of the No. 17 car in the NASCAR® Cup Series, driven by Chris Buescher. In 2020, our sports marketing efforts were extended when the National Hockey League (NHL®) awarded us as the preferred MRO supplier of the sport.\nSeasonality Seasonality has some impact on our sales. The first and fourth quarters of each year are typically our lowest volume periods, given their overlap with winter months in North America during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. The fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the Thanksgiving (October in Canada and November in the United States), Christmas, and New Year holiday periods, due to plant shut downs. In contrast, the second and third quarters of each year typically have higher revenues due to stronger non-residential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays (although Good Friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of July will always fall in the third quarter).\nCompetition Our business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas, and smaller regional or local distributors, which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products, in no particular order, are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.\nMarket strategies in industrial distribution are varied. With respect to products, many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broad-line offering over time; however, they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share. This association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors, though many smaller competitors do deploy a broad-line model. Means of serving the customer are even more diverse. For instance, many competitors maintain a local, branch-based presence in their markets, while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses, while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales. Recent years have seen the emergence of eCommerce solutions, such as websites, and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors, it also has introduced non-traditional web-based competitors into the marketplace. The diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base. The large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels, from a single distributor or a range of distributors, to procure the products they need in their operations.\nWe believe that better service, and a competitive selling advantage, can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers' location(s). As a result, we maintain in-market locations in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products. The convenience of a large number of in-market locations in a given area, combined with our ability to provide them with frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers, facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our FMI solutions, supported by an in-market location, provide a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each in-market location also enhances our ability to compete (see 'Employees' below).\nOur Onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers. Building on our core business strategy of the local branch, the Onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers, all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure.\n11 Human Capital Resources Employees At the end of 2023, we employed 23,201 full- and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 71% held a selling role. We characterize these personnel as follows: 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total Selling personnel (1) 16,512 71.2% 15,898 71.0% Distribution/Transportation personnel 4,042 17.4% 3,974 17.8% Manufacturing personnel 733 3.2% 733 3.3% Organizational support personnel (2) 1,914 8.2% 1,781 8.0% Total personnel 23,201 100.0% 22,386 100.0% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nEmployee Profile As of December 31, 2023, we had 23,201 employees worldwide, with 18,539 of those employees located in the United States (U.S.), 3,038 employees located in Canada and Mexico, and 1,624 employees located overseas in 24 other countries throughout the world. Based on our EEO-1 data for 2023, in the U.S., females and minorities constitute 24.0% and 23.6% of our workforce, respectively. We believe these absolute figures gain further context when viewed against two additional data sets. First, over the past ten years there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business. Since 2013, our female and minority workforces have grown 2.2x and 3.8x faster, respectively, than our overall U.S. workforce. This trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution, including the natural progression of our geographic expansion, the cycle of our promote-from-within philosophy, and efforts to improve hiring processes over time. Second, based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we believe Fastenal's mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction, which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates. For instance, relative to the 24.0% of our U.S. workforce that is female, the proportion of females in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 29.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Similarly, relative to the 23.6% of our U.S. workforce that are minorities, the proportion of non-white (a definition utilized by the U.S. Census Bureau) individuals in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 21.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Health and Safety Employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a multi-faceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Today, our health and safety programs span all operations including manufacturing, distribution centers, fleet and auto, and our branch and Onsite network. These key business units play a dynamic role in defining how we engage with our employees on health and safety. Trainings, audits, inspections, risk assessments, safety coaching, and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility safety and employee safety. In 2023, there were over 214,000 completed health and safety engagements, which is an increase of 7% compared to 2022. Our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance. We continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows.\nThis commitment to, and continuous improvement toward, a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results. A widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the Experience Modification Rate (EMR). An organization's EMR is established through the comparison of a company's past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages, which are compiled by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization. Industry averages are benchmarked at a 1.00 EMR, with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization's ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols, resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk. In 2023, Fastenal had an EMR of 0.49, which is 51% better than the average performance rate for our industry.\n12 In 2023, we achieved third-party re-certification for the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This certification illustrates the strength of our health and safety programs, as well as our commitment to continual improvement to better support our growing workforce. As our business model continues to grow through our branch and Onsite network, our customer critical programs have evolved to mitigate risk and incidents, while meeting customer specific needs. This partnership with our customers allows us to collaborate and expand our health and safety programs to enhance our customers' workplace safety performance. Employment and Compensation Philosophy Fastenal's success is defined by our people. Our cultural values – Ambition, Integrity, Innovation, and Teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols, and inform our employment and compensation philosophies. Several principles underpin our employment philosophy. One principle is decentralization: placing employees close to our customers' operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service. A second principle is that we are a passionately promote-from-within company, guided by a belief that if you work hard, make great decisions, learn from mistakes, and exemplify our cultural values, you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility. We believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment. As it relates to our compensation philosophy, we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success, as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort. We are guided by simple principles. First, compensation programs should be easy to understand, with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided. They should be calculable by the employee and numbers-driven (e.g., not subjective). Second, total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers. Third, employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal.\nApproximately 71% of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis, with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customer-facing employees. Typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month, along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts, paid monthly, based on growth in sales, gross or pre-tax profit achieved, and prudent management of working capital. In certain roles, there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals, most of which are focused on either customer service or better execution of company-wide activities.\nBecause we believe the growth in the company's stock value should be the reward for achieving long-term success consistent with being an owner, we have a stock option plan. In the case of certain foreign employees, we have a stock appreciation rights plan. All of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights. We believe our combination of short- and long-term rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and levels of employee retention and turnover.\nOur employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.\nTalent Acquisition and Development Fastenal's values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons to stay include training, opportunity, and a welcoming environment. From a practical standpoint, this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities. In accordance with our decentralized leadership structure, we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening. In light of our promote-from-within philosophy, we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire.\nOur Human Resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage. We have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions, supplemented with training through the Fastenal School of Business (FSB). We have a Diversity and Compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework, which ensures its integrity. Not only is this process followed for all new hires, we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions.\n13 The FSB (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company-specific training and development programs that are offered to our employees. The programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructor-led training, virtual instructor-led training, and online learning. FSB provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees' performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning, as well as training plans based on roles within the company. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business, such as leadership, effective best practices, sales and marketing, products, supply chain, and distribution.\nProduct Sourcing Endeavors Sourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with all relevant regulations and applicable standards. Our teams conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us and require them to provide additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics, quality, and reliability. This ensures they meet our standards in these areas and are complying with Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing third-party tools and global databases, Fastenal actively monitors government sanctions, denied party listings, withhold release orders, export restriction updates, financial status, adverse media, and multiple other official exclusion lists that provide information on any known risk of any entities and locations with which Fastenal engages, and screens all business partners against those lists. Additionally, we monitor key areas of trade-related risk, including dual-use goods, trade cases, anti-dumping and counter-vailing cases, and other protectionist trade measures for all countries that products are traded in. As part of our comprehensive Supply Chain Security program, we also evaluate our suppliers' approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate, and appropriately compensated, employees and ensure upstream supply chain visibility on globally sourced products. With a local and global supplier base, continuous monitoring and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are triggered when risk may be evident, ensuring a safeguard against poor and/or impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation or ability to effectively operate in the marketplace. This is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding, but for the life of the relationship with the supplier. This process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of non-compliance or potential risk, we work with the supplier to correct the situation. If remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with Fastenal's standards and code of conduct, alternative sources of supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance, ensuring that no matter where a customers' operations may take them, Fastenal has the infrastructure, resources, and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations.\nIn 2023, approximately 29% of our total company-wide inventory spend was with small and/or diverse businesses. This flows from our Supplier Diversity program, as part of which we are committed to building supply chain relationships with small businesses and businesses with diverse ownership including women, minorities, veterans, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) owned Certified LGBT Business Enterprise® Suppliers. Available Information Our Internet address for corporate and investor information is www.fastenal.com. The information contained on our website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on or through our website at www.fastenal.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n14 ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows: Company-Specific Risks Operational Risks Products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, or death linked to the use of those products by our customers. Some of our customers operate in challenging industries in which there is a material risk of catastrophic events. We are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers, some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk. If any of these events are linked to the use of any of our products by our customers, claims could be brought against us by those customers, by governmental authorities, and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them, we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place, the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available, or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us. Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems, or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner, could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues, and result in less efficient operations. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner. Our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities. Still, information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, cybersecurity incidents, telecommunication failures, and other problems. In addition, certain software used by us is licensed from, and certain services related to our information systems are provided by, third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us. It is also possible that we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our information systems. Our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of company and customer data, as well as the success of our growth drivers, is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems. If critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable, if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations, or if certain insurance coverages are limited in their capabilities or affordability, it could adversely affect our profitability and/or ability to grow.\nThe ability to adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. Additionally, our business relies on the use, validity, and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which include current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements, as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect our rights. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to liability, require us to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost, or otherwise cause us to modify our operations.\nCyber security incidents, or violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace. The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain, and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent such unauthorized access, and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event, including any cyber security event. The development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Consequently, despite our efforts, the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. There 15 can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security were to occur, it could interrupt our operations, subject us to additional legal, regulatory, and operating costs, and damage our reputation in the marketplace. In addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data. New privacy security laws and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016, the California Consumer Protection Act, and other similar privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. Our ability to successfully attract, develop, and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs, sales at existing selling locations, and the successful execution of our growth drivers. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including inside and outside branch associates, Onsite managers, national account sales representatives, and logistical and administrative support personnel, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high, particularly for less tenured employees. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels.\nChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could continue to cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. Changes in our customer and product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline. For example, we have experienced a sustained increase in the proportion of our sales attributable to both non-fastener products and national accounts and Onsite customers. Non-fastener products typically have a lower gross profit percentage than fasteners because in many cases non-fastener products are less technical, have shorter supply chains, and are easier to transport. Similarly, national accounts and Onsite customers typically have a lower gross profit percentage than smaller customers by virtue of their scale, available business, and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross profit percentages. Whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are offset by positive impacts to gross profit percentage during such year. Setting aside the circumstances of any given year or period, however, customer and product mix have contributed to the decline of our gross profit percentage over time and, based on the anticipated sources of our future growth, will likely continue to reduce our gross profit percentage into the foreseeable future. There are other variables that could cause our gross profit percentage to decline, including downward pressure on sales prices due to deflation, increases in overseas freight charges, the inability of freight revenue to leverage the expenses associated with our captive trucking fleet, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition. We could experience reductions in the volume of purchases we make from our suppliers, which could reduce supplier volume allowances. We may not be able to pass higher product costs along to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. We experienced a number of these variables in 2023. A softer manufacturing economy caused relative weakness in our more cyclical and higher gross margin fastener product line versus our non-fastener product lines. Similarly, we continued to execute initiatives aimed at accelerating key account penetration, which resulted in relative growth in our lower gross margin national account and Onsite customers. The combination of these two events produced pressure on our product gross profit percentage in 2023 from product and customer mix.\nOur operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings. Over time, we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses, including costs related to payroll, occupancy, freight, and information technology, among others, as our net sales have grown. However, historically, a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales, allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins. There are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past. For instance, it is typical that when demand declines, most commonly from cyclical or general market factors (though it could be due to customer losses or some other company-specific event), our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales. It is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales. In addition, market variables, which include but are not exclusive of labor rates, energy costs, legal costs, and health care costs, could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses so as to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings. Should any of these scenarios, or a combination of them, occur in the future, it is possible that our operating and pre-tax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue.\n16 Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and/or financial reporting could materially impact our business and results. Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. Any system of internal controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all systems of internal controls, internal controls over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation, economic loss, or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur competitive advantage in FMI solutions, which includes industrial vending (FASTVend) and bin stock (FASTStock and FASTBin) tools could be eliminated and, in the case of FASTVend and FASTBin, the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices. Certain circumstances could lead to a short-term inability to promote and/or install our FMI solutions. We believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software, our local presence (allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly and with less burden on our customers), our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks, and, particularly in North America, our distribution strength. These advantages have developed over time; however, other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own. Such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business. In addition, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for our vending devices, RFID technology, and IR technology used in our FASTVend and FASTBin platforms. While devices, software, and services can be obtained from other sources, loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in our failure to meet short- or long-term goals related to the numbers of FASTVend and FASTBin devices we are able to deploy. Certain circumstances may reduce short-term customer receptivity to adopting our FMI services. For instance, during periods of dramatic change in economic activity, some customers may prioritize managing existing operations over adopting new technologies until business circumstances change.\nOur inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations. Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership. In the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future, the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight and/or leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal, talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles. In addition, difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team, or recruiting suitable replacements, could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations.\nFailure to implement an effective Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy could result in financial losses or impair our corporate reputation. Customers, suppliers, employees, community partners, shareholders, and regulatory agencies are increasingly scrutinizing our ESG disclosures and practices and factoring the social impact of our policies and practices into whether and how they engage with us. Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: • the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; • the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; • increases in reporting and operating regulations around ESG may result in higher operating expenses and/or capital expenditures that could reduce our profitability and/or cash flow; • the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability, diversity, and other ESG standards that we may set; • the availability of effective and acceptable emission offset technologies or strategies in the event such tools will be necessary to achieve overall emission reduction and mitigation goals; and • our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets.\nAn actual or perceived inability to satisfactorily address the concerns and disclosure expectations of our stakeholders could adversely affect our corporate reputation, image, identity, brand equity, and status, which could hurt our ability to retain and acquire customers and employees, lead to penalties for non-compliance, and/or negatively impact the price performance of our common stock.\n17 We may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business. Our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within North America and abroad. In recent years, we have increased the resources devoted to developing a multi-dimensional, differentiated service offering, including our Digital Footprint (which incorporates our FMI and e-procurement capabilities), Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, and process and consumption analytics. While we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business, we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth. Failure to achieve any of our goals regarding our Digital Footprint, Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, analytics, or other growth drivers could negatively impact our long-term sales and profit growth. In addition, failure to identify appropriate targets for the growth drivers of our business or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our internally developed and/or externally communicated deployment objectives.\nThe ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our selling efforts and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete, our ability to generate additional sales, and our profit margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at our selling locations and through our specialist roles and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers' needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our selling locations and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins.\nThe ability to adequately protect our reputation may have an adverse impact on operations and profitability. The Fastenal name is valuable to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on our ability to provide high quality products, deliver consistent services, and improve our customer's business operations. Further, information on our company, including our products and services, can be more easily accessed and more quickly disseminated through traditional and social media and digital channels. Should we fail to deliver a positive customer experience or should our public image be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based in fact, it could jeopardize our reputation and discourage customers from purchasing our products and services, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to grow our revenues and profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or non-traditional competitors, which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although slowly consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented, and highly competitive industry. Our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, technological, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources, technological advancements, and services. Increased competition from brick-and-mortar retailers could cause us to lose market share, reduce our prices, or increase our spending. Similarly, the emergence of online retailers, whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major, non-traditional competitors, could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods. These pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage over time.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies. Historically, the vast majority of our growth has been organic. However, we have completed several acquisitions over the last decade and expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including, among others, a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business, inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition, diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues, and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business, our industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions. Equity Risks Our stock price will fluctuate, and at times these fluctuations may be volatile. The prices of markets and individual equities tend to fluctuate. These fluctuations commonly reflect events, many of which may be fully or partially outside of our control, that may change investor's perception of our future earnings growth prospects, including changes in economic conditions, ability to execute business strategy, the impacts of public policy, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, and many other factors. While the sources of stock price fluctuation can be common across companies, the magnitude of these fluctuations can vary for different companies. This is commonly measured by beta, which is an individual stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. Our stock price has traditionally had a high beta value, which means fluctuations in the price of our shares will often be sharper than what is experienced by broader market indices. We can provide no assurance that the above-average historical volatility of our stock versus the broader market will moderate. Volatility in our stock price could also result in the 18 filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management's time, attention, and resources. There can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time. Stock prices, including ours, are commonly thought to be a function of earnings compounded by a multiple. This is often referred to as a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, although other forms of multiples are often utilized by investors to value our company's shares. Historically, investors have given our earnings a higher multiple, or premium, than is typical of the broader industrial sector with which we are typically associated. We believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth, profitability, and returns. However, to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies and/or poorly navigate the risks that surround our business, including those described throughout this section, or to the extent our industry (industrial distribution, or industrial stocks in general) loses favor in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program. Although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates. In addition, although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2022, 2020, and prior years through these programs, we may discontinue doing so at any time. Any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, to increase those dividends, or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations, the price of our common stock, credit conditions, and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nGeneral Economic and Operating Risks Operational Risks A downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. In general, our sales are the result of planned and unplanned customer spending on products used in production of final goods, infrastructure construction, and/or the maintenance of facilities. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others: • general business conditions; • business conditions in our principal markets; • changes in the value of local currencies relative to our functional currency, the United States dollar, • interest rates; • increases (inflation) or decreases (deflation) in the cost of products from our vendors, transportation services, energy and fuel prices, and electrical power rates; • liquidity in credit markets; • taxation; • government regulations and actions; • the impact on customer demand or availability of goods and services based on labor shortages or work stoppages; • unemployment trends; • terrorist attacks and acts of war; • impact of higher sustained global temperatures (global warming); • acts of God, which may include, but are not limited to, weather events, earthquakes, pandemics, etc.; and • other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.\nA downturn in either the national or local economies where we operate, or in the principal markets served by us, or changes in any of the other factors described above, could negatively impact sales at our in-market locations, sales through our other selling channels, and the level of profitability of those in-market locations and other selling channels. The primary variable affecting our results in 2023 was a softening in manufacturing sector business conditions.\nProducts manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available, which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results. We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, and other foreign countries. Our suppliers could discontinue or experience disruption in selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers' control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations, disruption in trade relationships and agreements, political unrest, war, disease, labor availability, or changes in local economic conditions. Additionally, the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial, capacity, or other difficulties. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is 19 unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing products and services of comparable quality and utility. Trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult and/or more costly, and could adversely impact our gross and/or operating profit percentage. We source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of North America, primarily Asia. We have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from Asia through our wholly-owned, Asia-based subsidiary, FASTCO Trading Co., Ltd. and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources. This was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production, but over time we have expanded our non-fastener sourcing as well, and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term. In light of this, changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations, our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers and/or impact the cost or price of our products, with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results. China represents a significant source of product for North America. In addition, we move and source products within North America. Any trading disruption (tariffs, product restrictions, etc.) between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business. There can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future, with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business. The degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies, their timing and duration, and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues.\nChanges in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales, cost of sales, gross profit percentage, distribution expenses, and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating income. Our suppliers can experience significant fluctuation over time in the cost of raw materials (e.g., steel, plastic, etc.) used to produce their products. They can also experience significant fluctuation in the cost of energy consumed in their production processes and in the cost of fuel consumed to transport their products. These suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. We also consume energy and fuel in our own operations, and can experience direct and significant fluctuation in our own costs. Increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit to decline, or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries, which could cause our sales to those customers to decline. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales. Given that we were founded and remain based in the United States and that we are publicly traded in the United States, we report our results based on the United States dollar. Because the functional currency related to most of our non-United States operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar as our Mexican activities are primarily conducted in United States dollars and our non-North American operations are relatively small in scale. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure. If we decide to do so in the future, we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect. We believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that North American market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed $140 billion. This figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreed-upon demand and market share statistics. Instead, we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources. If we have overestimated the size of our market, and in doing so, underestimated our current share of it, the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe. Similarly, we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies, such as FMI solutions and Onsite locations. Within North America, we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 1.7 million devices and we have identified over 12,000 customer locations with the potential to implement our Onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base. We have identified additional markets, such as government, healthcare, and academia, and geographies into which we can sell our FMI solutions, which would increase the number of identified potential FMI solutions or Onsite locations. However, our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies, which could extend the sales cycle. As is the case for total market size, we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources. These estimates are based on our business model today, and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies could cause them to change. In 20 addition, the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace (such as changes in customer concentration or needs), a change in the nature of that business strategy, or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or Onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity.\nThe industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share, gross profit, and operating income. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating, reflecting two factors. First, our customer's needs are evolving to reflect a greater awareness of the total cost and risk of fulfillment and their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations, including outside of North America. Second, providing these capabilities to our customers requires increasing investment in hardware, software, and analytic capabilities that require a certain degree of scale to support. While we believe that in a fragmented market such as exists for industrial supplies these emerging trends favor large distributors such as Fastenal, as the industry consolidates into fewer and larger competitors it may become more difficult to differentiate our product and service offering from that of our competitors. We also continue to see consolidation among our suppliers. This trend could result in fewer and larger suppliers, with greater channel power and negotiating leverage. There can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation within our industry or among our suppliers. In either or both cases, the trend toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our growth and/ or gross and operating profit. Furthermore, as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors, or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share.\nThe occurrence of a widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A public health crisis, if sufficiently widespread as to affect economic activity, could negatively impact our business. Mitigation efforts and prescriptions may be facilitated by regulatory authorities, which could limit our flexibility to pursue alternative, potentially more favorable, means of limiting these negative impacts. The effects on our business efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis may include a reduction in demand, inefficiencies due to workplace accommodations, reduced availability of personnel, supply chain disruption, or constraints on product availability, among other difficulties. In any such event, the severity, duration, and extent of the crisis can be difficult to predict, which can make it difficult to anticipate the magnitude and length of the impact on our sales, profits, and/or cash flow. It can also be difficult to anticipate what the effect on business conditions will be as the impacts of any public health crisis fades and mitigating policies are reversed. Inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks Our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, damage to our reputation, or the termination of contracts. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption laws, product compliance laws, environmental laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, advertising regulations, data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016, with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country) and cyber security requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products, labor and employment laws, and anti-competition regulations. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation, administration, and performance of our governmental contracts. We are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business. Ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business, and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts. 21 Tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results. We are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, and/or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed which contained tax-related provisions. We did not experience, and do not anticipate experiencing in the near future, any meaningful impact to our tax rates from the legislation. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and legal matters, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal control, and other changes that could increase our operating costs. We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from business transactions or the operation of our business. Due to the nature of our business, these proceedings may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, suits arising from our trucking operations, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor, intellectual property matters, or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results. As of December 31, 2023, we had $260.0 of outstanding debt obligations, all in the form of senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement). The notes issued under our Master Note Agreement carry a fixed interest rate and consist of five series and are described in further detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We also have borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) of $835.0, but no loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the rate on which may vary daily, and mature on September 28, 2027. We currently have the capacity under our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement to increase borrowings in the future to finance stock purchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital additions, acquisitions, or other investments. Should we seek to increase our borrowings during periods of volatility and disruption in the United States credit markets, financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain. This was not a material consideration in 2023. The cost of servicing any existing balances on our Credit Facility could increase if interest rates increase due to the SOFR-based interest rate provided for under our Credit Facility.\nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.\n22 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have established processes and procedures for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. These processes are in place to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Annual risk assessments are performed and incorporated as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) organizational process, which is overseen by our Board of Directors (the Board) and the Audit Committee, along with Executive Leadership. Our information security management system (ISMS) program is aligned to ISO 27001, which is an international standard to manage information security. ISO 27001 is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the world's largest developer of voluntary standards, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\nOur information technology (IT) security department, led by our Senior Vice President (SVP) IT Infrastructure & Security, is tasked with monitoring cybersecurity and operational risks related to information security and system disruption. The team employs measures designed to protect against, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats, and has implemented processes and procedures aligned with our information security management system to support and promote resilient programs. This includes: • Enterprise security framework and cyber security standards; • Cyber security awareness and training plans; • Security assessments and monitoring; • Restricted physical access to critical areas, servers, and network equipment; • Incident response, crisis management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans; and • Third-party IT vendor risk management process to identify, assess, and manage risks presented by our IT vendors and business partners.\nOur IT security department maintains a playbook to respond to potential cybersecurity threats. We conduct tabletop exercises for tactical response readiness, perform regular security scans of our environment both from an external and internal perspective, as well as work with a qualified third-party vendor to perform penetration tests of our environment. Any identified risks are included in our overall risk management program, and internal and external auditors validate our IT controls on a regular basis.\nWe conduct organization-wide cybersecurity training and compliance exercises in connection with our information security program. This training consists of educational material and compliance testing administered to all of our employees, which is tracked and recorded throughout the year. Results and progress are shared with Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board. Employee phishing tests are conducted on a regular basis. Employees who do not follow protocol are redirected for additional training. We have implemented an IT vendor risk management policy that provides guidance in managing risks associated with IT vendors and business partners. We have also established a third-party risk management program and conduct pre-onboarding security assessments and annual re-assessments of our service providers to collect, track, and manage third-party security controls based upon the risk presented to the business. Any issues identified during assessment are tracked through to remediation.\nGovernance Our Board of Directors and Audit Committee are actively engaged in the oversight of our risk management, including cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on information security from our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security. Additionally, Executive Leadership is briefed on information security at least quarterly by members of our IT security, compliance, governance, and audit teams. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing our risk exposure to information security, cybersecurity, and data protection, as well as the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our IT security department, which assesses and manages our risks from cybersecurity threats, is led by our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security, who reports to our Senior EVP IT. Additional oversight for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk include Executive sponsors, Information Technology, Human Resources, IT Governance Risk and Compliance, Internal Audit, and Legal, as well as members of our Information Security Risk Council, IT Risk Committee, and Enterprise Risk Management teams.\nWe have in place an incident response plan to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Information Security Risk Council, Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board are notified of any material cybersecurity incidents through an established escalation process. Additionally, we maintain a qualified third-party vendor relationship which is available to the team for on-demand incident response and investigation, as needed.\n23 The IT security department team members have degrees applicable to cybersecurity, including Bachelors in Information Systems, Computer Science, Management Information Systems and/or Masters in Cybersecurity, and hold professional certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Offensive Security Certified Professional, Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Defensible Security Architecture, GIAC Forensic Examiner, GIAC Incident Handling, and GIAC Open Source Intelligence. Our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security holds a Cybersecurity and Privacy Law Certificate from Mitchell Hamline School of Law, and has 28 years of experience in systems, network, and database administration. Additionally, our Senior IT security department manager is an Offensive Security Certified Professional, and holds GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC), with over 25 years of experience in network performance, availability, and protection.\nImpact of Cybersecurity Threats There have been no previous cybersecurity incidents which have materially affected us to date, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, any future potential risks from cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to exploitation of vulnerabilities, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain attacks, or other similar threats may materially affect us, including our execution of business strategy, reputation, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n24 ITEM 2.

In 2024, an additional ASRS will go live at this property. (4) This facility contains an ASRS with capacity of 14,000 pallet locations, in addition to the 41,000 tote locations for small parts.\n(5) During 2021, we acquired land for future expansion of our distribution center in Magna, Utah, and, as of November 2023, earthwork is underway. This building is expected to be complete in June of 2025 and will be approximately 290,000 square feet.\n(6) In December 2018, we purchased an additional distribution center in High Point, North Carolina with approximately 750,000 total square feet. Approximately 395,000 square feet will be leased by the building's previous owner until December 2024. We currently utilize approximately 355,000 square feet for distribution activities.\n25 We also own, and in some cases, lease, the following support facilities, excluding selling locations: Location Purpose Leased Approximate Square Feet Winona, Minnesota Manufacturing facility 121,000 Indianapolis, Indiana Manufacturing facility 198,000 Houston, Texas Manufacturing facility 122,000 Wallingford, Connecticut Manufacturing facility 177,000 Rockford, Illinois Manufacturing facility 101,000 Johor, Malaysia Manufacturing facility 30,000 Brno-Lisen, Czech Republic Manufacturing facility X 20,000 Leeds, United Kingdom Manufacturing facility X 28,000 Winona, Minnesota Multiple facilities for office space, storage, and packaging operations 421,000 Bangalore, India International information technology office X 45,000 In addition, we own 154 buildings that house our in-market locations in various cities throughout North America.\nAll other buildings we occupy are leased. Leased branches range from approximately 3,000 to 20,000 square feet, with lease terms of up to 120 months (most initial lease terms are for 36 to 60 months).\nWe currently own land for future distribution center expansion and development. If economic conditions are suitable in the future, we will consider purchasing branch locations to house our older branches. It is anticipated the majority of new branch locations will continue to be leased. It is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular branch operations, when desirable. Our experience has been that there is sufficient space suitable for our needs and available for leasing.\nITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings, if any, is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.\n26 PART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Common Stock Data Dollar amounts in this section are stated in whole numbers.\nOur shares are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol 'FAST'.

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons for the current year and the prior year. Discussions of 2021 items can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Business and Operational Overview Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of more than 3,400 in-market locations. Our largest end market is manufacturing. Sales to these customers includes products for both original equipment manufacturing (OEM), where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers, and manufacturing, repair and operations (MRO), where our products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers. We also service general and commercial contractors in non-residential end markets as well as farmers, truckers, railroads, oil exploration companies, oil production and refinement companies, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our branches, Onsite locations, and customers are primarily located in North America, though we continue to grow our non-North American presence as well.\nIt is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace: First, it is big. We estimate the North American marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of $140 billion per year (and we have expanded beyond North America) and no company has a significant portion of this market. Second, many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive, but the cost and time to manage, procure, and transport these products can be quite meaningful. Third, many customers prefer to reduce their number of MRO and OEM suppliers to simplify their business, while also utilizing various technologies and models (including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly) to improve availability and reduce waste. Lastly, we believe the markets are efficient. In our view, this means that companies who grow market share are those that develop differentiated capabilities that provide the greatest value to the customer.\nOur approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto Growth Through Customer Service® and our tagline Where Industry Meets Innovation™. The concept of growth is simple: find more customers every day that value the services we provide and increase our activity with them. However, execution is hard work. First, we recruit service-minded individuals to support customers and empower them to operate in a decentralized fashion to maximize their flexibility to solve customer problems. We support these customer-facing resources with a supply chain capability that is speedy, efficient, and cost-effective. This has formed the foundation of our high-touch model since inception. Second, we invest in, develop, and deploy capabilities that allow us to illuminate and provide greater control over a customer's supply chain. These capabilities range from service models that take advantage of our local presence and/or our ability to more efficiently manage complex procurement needs, to hardware and software technologies that promote actionable data capture, improve operating efficiencies, and reduce supply chain risk. Third, we strive to generate strong profits, which produce the cash flow necessary to support our growth, our product and technology development, and the needs of our customers.\nThe ultimate aim of this 'high-touch, high-tech' approach to gaining market share is to allow us to get closer to our customers, going so far as to be right to the point of consumption within customers' facilities. Marrying our presence, capabilities and technologies deepens our relationships and our understanding of our customers' day-to-day opportunities and obstacles. This, in turn, enhances our ability to provide innovative and comprehensive solutions to our customers' challenges. By doing these things every day, Fastenal remains a growth-centric organization.\n29 Executive Overview The following table presents a performance summary of our results of operations for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 YOY Change 2021 YOY Change Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 5.2% $ 6,010.9 16.1% Business days 253 254 253 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 5.7% $ 23.8 15.7% Gross profit $ 3,354.5 3,215.8 4.3% $ 2,777.2 15.8% % of net sales 45.7% 46.1% 46.2% Operating and administrative expenses $ 1,825.8 1,762.2 3.6% $ 1,559.8 13.0% % of net sales 24.9% 25.2% 26.0% Operating income $ 1,528.7 1,453.6 5.2% $ 1,217.4 19.4% % of net sales 20.8% 20.8% 20.3% Earnings before income taxes $ 1,522.0 1,440.0 5.7% $ 1,207.8 19.2% % of net sales 20.7% 20.6% 20.1% Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 6.3% $ 925.0 17.5% Diluted net earnings per share $ 2.02 1.89 6.7% $ 1.60 17.8% Note – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the United States) in the period.\n2023 was a year of modest economic contraction in our key markets. The Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for the United States averaged 47.1 for the full year and remained below 50, the threshold demarcating manufacturing growth or contraction, every month. Industrial Production for the United States reflected moderating business activity, with markets that are most relevant to us, such as Fabricated Metals and Machinery, declining at an accelerating rate through the year. In addition, inflation in product costing flattened out, with some deflation emerging in fastener products. The combined effect of these dynamics was to produce daily sales growth in 2023 that slowed appreciably from 2022. We continued to migrate to a key accounts-focused model, expand our Onsite footprint, grow our installed base of FMI hardware, and lift the proportion of sales that run through our Digital Footprint. The efficiencies these investments provide and good organizational control of discretionary expenses allowed us to achieve a stable operating profit margin despite the challenges stemming from this slower and less inflationary environment. We also produced record operating cash flow which, combined with our confidence in the future cash generation capability of our business model, allowed us to pay a supplemental fifth dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full-time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our investments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of active Onsite locations), and weighted FMI devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period.\nQ4 2023 Q4 2022 Twelve-month % Change Selling personnel - absolute employee headcount 16,512 15,898 3.9 % Selling personnel - FTE employee headcount 15,070 14,476 4.1 % Total personnel - absolute employee headcount 23,201 22,386 3.6 % Total personnel - FTE employee headcount 20,721 19,854 4.4 % Number of branch locations 1,597 1,683 -5.1 % Number of active Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 12.3 % Number of in-market locations 3,419 3,306 3.4 % Weighted FMI devices (MEU installed count) 113,138 102,151 10.8 % 30 During the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 867. This reflects an increase in our total FTE selling personnel of 594 to support growth in the marketplace and sales initiatives targeting customer acquisition. We had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 124 to support increased product throughput at our facilities and to expand our local inventory fulfillment terminals (LIFTs). We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 149 that relates primarily to personnel investments in information technology, manufacturing, and operational support, such as purchasing and product development.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites activated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Branch openings 10 12 Branch closures, net of conversions (96) (122) Onsite activations 329 306 Onsite closures, net of conversions (130) (99) Our in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our in-market locations because of significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree international branches, which has more than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network. In any period, the number of locations closed tends to reflect normal churn in our business, whether due to redefining or exiting customer relationships, the shutting or relocation of customer facilities that host our locations, or a customer decision, as well as our ongoing review of underperforming locations. We will continue to open or close locations to sustain and improve our network, support our growth drivers, and manage our operating expenses. However, we believe the strategic rationalization that has produced the meaningful decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and we expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2023 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 45.7 % 46.1 % Operating and administrative expenses 24.9 % 25.2 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.8 % Net interest expense -0.1 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.7 % 20.6 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2023 2022 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 Percentage change 5.2% 16.1% Business days 253 254 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 Percentage change 5.7% 15.7% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.3% -0.5% The increase in net sales noted above for 2023 was due to higher unit sales of MRO, OEM, and construction supplies, as well as higher pricing as further set forth below.\n31 We believe higher unit sales in 2023 were primarily a result of our ability to gain market share, as most measures of industrial activity were flat to down throughout the period. Despite this challenging environment, in 2023 we produced net sales growth of 5.2% and, owing to one fewer selling day in the period, daily sales growth of 5.7%. Growth was led by our transportation customers, which includes sales to transportation services customers as the warehousing operations of retailer-oriented customers, and manufacturing end markets, which benefit disproportionately from our shift to a key account model. Our non-residential construction and reseller customers contracted during the period, which we believe is due to our shift to a key account model which tends to de-emphasize walk-in, over-the-counter, and infrequent transactions. Price contributed 160 to 190 basis points to our net sales growth in 2023. This contribution to growth from price was primarily due to easier comparisons in the first six months of 2023. For instance, in the first six months of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 240 to 270 basis points, while in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 110 to 140 basis points and 50 to 80 basis points, respectively. We increased total Onsite locations, the installed base of FMI devices, and our Digital Footprint in 2023, which enhanced the value we provide to our customers and supported our growth and efficiency. The rate of penetration we achieved with these growth drivers was uneven, however. We signed 326 Onsites in 2023, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 375 to 400 units and slightly below the prior year signings of 356 units. We signed 24,126 FMI MEUs, meeting our goal at the start of 2023 of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs and meaningfully above the prior year signings of 20,735 MEUs. We expanded the proportion of our sales running through our Digital Footprint to 56.1%, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 65.0% but above the prior year level of 49.3%. Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2023 2022 Fasteners 32.4% 34.0% Safety supplies 21.2% 20.8% Other product lines 46.4% 45.2% The shifts in product mix in 2023 compared to 2022 are largely attributable to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. Second, pricing for fasteners has decelerated at a faster pace than non-fastener products. These dynamics produced a meaningful divergence in the daily sales growth rates of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2023.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2023 11.2% 9.6% 6.8% 7.8% 5.2% 4.7% 3.7% 3.6% 5.0% 1.9% 3.8% 5.3% 2022 14.9% 21.3% 19.1% 20.3% 17.6% 16.0% 18.1% 16.1% 13.7% 13.6% 10.2% 8.0% 32 Sequential Trends We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.\nHistory has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days and/or seasons impact certain end markets, particularly non-residential construction. The first landing centers on Easter and the Good Friday holiday that precedes it, which in any given year can fall in March or April, the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our non-residential construction business and with the Christmas/New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.\nThe table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2023' and '2022' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '23Delta' and '22Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark. It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform. Jan.(1) Feb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative Change from Jan. to Oct.\nBenchmark (2) 0.2% 1.5% 3.8% -0.5% 2.7% 2.0% -3.1% 2.9% 3.6% -1.9% 11.2% 2023 -0.4% 1.7% 1.0% -0.2% 0.7% -0.2% -2.6% 1.3% 4.0% -3.0% 2.3% 23Delta -0.6% 0.1% -2.9% 0.2% -2.0% -2.1% 0.5% -1.6% 0.4% -1.1% -8.8% 2022 1.7% 3.1% 3.6% -1.2% 3.2% 0.2% -1.6% 1.3% 2.7% -0.1% 11.7% 22Delta 1.5% 1.6% -0.2% -0.7% 0.6% -1.7% 1.5% -1.6% -0.9% 1.8% 0.5% (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2) The benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month. As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\n33 A graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2023 2022 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 End Market Performance We estimate approximately 70% to 75% of our business is with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing, a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market. The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 14.4% 10.4% 6.2% 4.7% 8.9% 2022 23.9% 23.1% 22.6% 16.0% 21.3% We estimate approximately 25% to 30% of our business is with customers engaged in a wide range of activities, none of which individually constitute 10% of sales. This includes non-residential construction, reseller, transportation, and government customers. The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 -3.7% -5.3% -1.3% 0.9% -2.4% 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 34 Product Performance Our products fall into two functional subsets: (1) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts, which become part of a customer's finished good and (2) maintenance, repair, and operation (MRO), which maintain the facilities and equipment used by our customers.\nWhile certain products in our other product categories have an OEM application, such as welding consumables or metal cutting carbides, the majority of our sales for OEM applications are of fasteners. As a result, the best way to understand the change in our production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line (which represents 30% to 35% of our business). From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 7.0% 0.0% -2.0% -2.3% 0.7% 2022 24.6% 21.2% 18.2% 9.1% 18.1% By contrast, while we do sell significant quantities of MRO fasteners, the best way to understand the change in our MRO business is to examine the results in our non-fastener product lines, which include safety, tools, janitorial, and other products. From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 10.3% 9.2% 7.5% 6.6% 8.4% 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% Our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles, but because it is more dependent on whether a facility is operating than how much product that facility is producing, it does tend to exhibit less volatility in its growth than our fastener business. We also expect growth of our non-fastener products to outperform growth of our fastener products over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 45.7% 45.5% 45.9% 45.5% 45.7% 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.7% in 2023 and 46.1% in 2022. This decrease was primarily related to two factors. First, in 2023 customer and product mix had a negative effect on our gross profit percentage. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from larger customers, including Onsites, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we had higher organizational/overhead costs, including from higher inbound freight costs and working capital needs being relieved from inventory and generating higher period costs. These negative effects were partly offset by favorable freight costs, which reflects elevated domestic freight revenue leveraging what are relatively stable costs to support our captive fleet, lower expenses related to external freight providers, and lower fuel costs. Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 24.9% in 2023 from 25.2% in 2022. This primarily reflected improvement, as a percentage of net sales, in employee-related expenses as bonuses and commissions were down as a result of slower sales and profit growth in 2023 versus the prior year.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 3.4 % 14.7 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 4.2 % 2.6 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 4.2 % 18.5 % 35 Employee-related expenses include: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes.\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation. This was partly offset by a decline in bonuses reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Selling personnel (1) 4.1 % 7.9 % Distribution/Transportation personnel 4.2 % 8.4 % Manufacturing personnel 0.1 % 12.4 % Organizational support personnel (2) 8.6 % 9.5 % Total personnel 4.4 % 8.3 % (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOccupancy-related expenses include: (1) building rent and depreciation, (2) building utility costs, (3) equipment related to our branches and distribution locations, and (4) industrial vending equipment and bins utilized as part of FMI services (we consider this hardware to be a logical extension of our in-market operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses).\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: slightly higher depreciation and expenses related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents related to higher inflation and branch size.\nAll other operating and administrative expenses include: (1) selling-related transportation, (2) information technology (IT) expenses, (3) general corporate expenses, which consists of legal expenses, general insurance expenses, travel and marketing expenses, etc., and (4) sales of property and equipment.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: higher spending on information technology; higher general insurance costs; increased spending on travel and supplies; and higher bad debt expense. These elements were only partly offset by increased contributions from our supplier collaboration programs and increased income from asset sales related to our field truck fleet.\nNet Interest Our net interest expense was $6.7 in 2023 compared to $13.6 in 2022. We carried lower average debt balances in 2023 relative to the prior year, with cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. This was only partly offset by slightly higher average rates against borrowings under our Credit Facility due to changing interest rate levels in the marketplace. We also generated higher interest income in 2023 relative to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes. The decrease in our tax rate in 2023 is due primarily to an increase in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options.\n36 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 Basic EPS 2.02 1.89 Diluted EPS 2.02 1.89 Percentage Change 2023 2022 Net earnings 6.3 % 17.5 % Basic EPS 6.7 % 17.7 % Diluted EPS 6.7 % 17.8 % 2023 2022 Tax Rate 24.1 % 24.5 % During 2023, net earnings per share increased, primarily due to higher sales, lower net interest expense, a lower tax rate, and lower average fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of our buying back shares in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash provided $ 1,432.7 941.0 % of net earnings 124.0% 86.6% In 2023, we experienced an increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. The improvement in operating cash flow in 2023, as a percent of net earnings, reflects the reduced demand for working capital as a result of an improved supply chain and, to a lesser degree, slower business activity relative to the prior year.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2023 2023 2023 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,087.6 74.4 7.3% Inventories 1,522.7 (185.3) -10.8% Trade working capital $ 2,610.3 (110.9) -4.1% Accounts payable $ 264.1 9.2 3.6% Trade working capital, net $ 2,346.2 (120.1) -4.9% Net sales in last three months $ 1,758.6 63.0 3.7% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to three factors. First, our receivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due to relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. Third, and to a lesser degree, customers have historically delayed payments at the end of years that are economically challenged, and we saw that effect in 2023.\n37 Our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity, though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable. One reason for this is because it is cyclical. We source significant quantities of product from overseas, and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. As a result, trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions. A second reason relates to product cost and the length of our supply chain. A significant proportion of our products, particularly fasteners, are sourced from Asia and transported primarily by ship and rail to our North American network for sale. This requires us to purchase a meaningful quantity of our products months in advance of those products being available for sale in our North American facilities. Product that is in transit is in our inventory but is not available for sale, which can create a lag in our ability to adjust inventory levels or costs in response to rapid changes in economic or cost conditions. A third reason for increases in our inventory balances is our growth drivers, including our FMI offerings, Onsite channel, and international expansion, all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory.\nIn 2023, our inventories decreased, reflecting the absence of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. Our response at the time was to deepen our inventory as a means of maintaining high service to our customers, particularly for imported inventory. Dissipation of these disruptions has allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle. It is also likely that slower business activity reduced the level of inventory our customers required us to maintain to meet their production needs.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in accounts payable was primarily attributable to our product purchases increasing to support the growth in our business. The growth in our accounts payable balance is below the growth in our sales, which reflects the dissipation of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. This allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2023 2022 Selling locations 64% 58% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 36% 42% Total 100% 100% Lease Obligations We have facilities, equipment, and vehicles leased under operating leases. A discussion of our lease obligations is contained in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash used $ 161.2 163.0 % of net earnings 14.0% 15.0% Our net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was comparable to 2022 and primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures. Property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of: (1) purchases related to industrial vending, (2) purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers, (3) spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems, (4) the addition of fleet vehicles, (5) expansion, improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties, and (6) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, typically for the planned disposition of pick-up trucks as well as distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business, are netted against these purchases and additions.\n38 Set forth below is a recap of our 2023 and 2022 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2023 2022 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 83.9 97.8 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 24.0 21.5 Data processing software and equipment 33.4 30.6 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 7.0 12.4 Vehicles 24.5 11.5 Purchases of property and equipment 172.8 173.8 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (12.2) (11.4) Net capital expenditures 160.6 162.4 % of net sales 2.2% 2.3% % of net earnings 13.9% 14.9% Our net capital expenditures in 2023 were comparable to 2022, though they were below our original expectations for net capital investment during the year. The slower business environment in 2023 reduced the need to purchase certain equipment at the pace originally anticipated. We also saw the timing of certain outlays pushed out and, to a lesser extent, longer lead times on certain materials. It does not reflect the cancellation of any significant initiatives, and much of the spending is expected to occur in 2024 when we see our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, being in a range of $225.0 to $245.0. This increase reflects spending to complete our Utah distribution center, investments in picking technology and equipment in our hubs and branches, higher outlays for FMI hardware reflecting our higher targeted signings and a slight build in device inventory, and an increase in spending on information technology.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities The increase in net cash used in financing activities reflects higher dividend payments, including a supplemental payment in December of 2023, and a reduction in our outstanding debt obligations. These uses of cash were only partly offset by the absence of common stock purchases that we made in the prior year and, to a lesser degree, the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Cash dividends paid $ 1,016.8 711.3 % of net earnings 88.0% 65.4% Purchases of common stock — 237.8 % of net earnings —% 21.9% Total returned to shareholders $ 1,016.8 949.1 % of net earnings 88.0% 87.3% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (30.1) (9.2) % of net earnings -2.6% -0.8% Debt obligations payments (proceeds), net $ 295.0 (165.0) % of net earnings 25.5% -15.2% Net cash used $ 1,281.7 774.9 % of net earnings 111.0% 71.3% Stock Purchases In 2023, we did not purchase any of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\n39 Dividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on January 17, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78. This included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023 reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24.\nDebt In order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business, expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers, pay dividends, we have borrowed under our Credit Facility and our Master Note Agreement in recent periods.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2023 as follows: Peak borrowings 2023 First quarter $ 565.0 Second quarter 470.0 Third quarter 350.0 Fourth quarter 330.0 As of December 31, 2023, we had $0.0 outstanding under the Credit Facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount of $32.7. As of December 31, 2023, we had loans outstanding under the Master Note Agreement of $260.0. Descriptions of our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, debt, and lease obligations, each of which are discussed in more detail earlier in this section. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions but we do not believe any of these liabilities will be material. A discussion of income taxes is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnremitted Foreign Earnings Approximately $213.2 of cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries on December 31, 2023. These funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash. We have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the U.S., even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Inflation In 2023, we observed easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping) resulting in stable costs for most of our product offering. As a result, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2023 and we saw our contribution to growth in daily sales due to price moderate throughout the year. The exception to this stability was cost deflation for imported goods, which resulted in modest price deflation specifically in our fastener product line over the course of the year. The net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2023.\n40 PRIOR YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2022 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2022 2021 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 46.1 % 46.2 % Operating and administrative expenses 25.2 % 26.0 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.3 % Net interest expense -0.2 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.6 % 20.1 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2022 2021 Net sales $ 6,980.6 6,010.9 Percentage change 16.1% 6.4% Business days 254 253 Daily sales $ 27.5 23.8 Percentage change 15.7% 7.3% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.5% 0.6% The increase in net sales noted above for 2022 was due to higher unit sales of MRO and OEM supplies to traditional manufacturing and construction customers and higher pricing as further set forth below.\nHigher unit sales in 2022 were a result of healthy economic activity throughout the period, though we did observe some moderation in demand as the year progressed. This moderation in demand, combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed, produced daily sales growth of 18.1% in the first half of 2022, daily sales growth of 13.3% in the second half of 2022, and daily sales growth of 8.0% in December 2022. Growth was led by our manufacturing customers, with particular strength in markets involved with commodity and capital goods production. Our non-residential construction customers grew on an annual basis, but turned slightly negative in the fourth quarter. We believe the relative underperformance of this customer category reflects deliberate shifts in our branch strategy that de-emphasized walk-in and over-the-counter transactions. We also experienced a normalization in other aspects of the operating environment in 2022, specifically the dissipation or moderation over the course of the year of product and transportation inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor market constraints. This affected two aspects of our growth during the period.\nFirst, price contributed 540 to 570 basis points to our net sales growth in 2022. However, as inflationary pressures eased and product availability improved, the need for aggressive pricing actions declined. The absence of such actions combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed resulted in the contribution from price to net sales growth moderating, from averaging 620 to 650 basis points in the first half of 2022, to averaging 450 to 480 basis points in the second half of 2022 and to averaging 350 to 380 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nSecond, as inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints became more predictable and manageable and then largely dissipated, it allowed our customers to shift from short-term business management to long-term strategic planning. This, in turn, provided us more opportunities to engage with customers over our key growth drivers, including Onsite and FMI. As a result, while we did not reach the signings goals we had set out at the start of the year, we saw a meaningful increase in signings in 2022 over the prior year, and a return to near pre-pandemic levels. We signed 356 Onsites in 2022, below our goal of 375 to 400 units but above the prior year (274 signings). Similarly, we signed 20,735 FMI MEUs, below our goal of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs but above the prior year (19,311 MEUs).\n41 Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2022 2021 Fasteners 34.0% 33.3% Safety supplies 20.8% 21.2% Other product lines 45.2% 45.5% The shifts in product mix in 2022 compared to 2021 largely reflect the reversal of pandemic-related activity combined with the relative growth of our more cyclical fastener line as growth in manufacturing and construction end markets accelerated as the post-pandemic North American economy recovered.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2022 14.9 % 21.3 % 19.1 % 20.3 % 17.6 % 16.0 % 18.1 % 16.1 % 13.7 % 13.6 % 10.2 % 8.0 % 2021 6.5 % 1.5 % 7.5 % 1.2 % -3.2 % 1.7 % 9.7 % 9.0 % 11.1 % 14.1 % 13.2 % 16.5 % Sequential Trends The table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2022' and '2021' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '22Delta' and '21Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark.\n42 It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform.\nJan. (1) Feb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative Change from Jan. to Oct.\nBenchmark (2) -0.1% 0.8% 3.4% 0.1% 2.2% 1.9% -3.3% 3.1% 3.4% -2.1% 9.5% 2022 1.7% 3.1% 3.6% -1.2% 3.2% 0.2% -1.6% 1.3% 2.7% -0.1% 11.7% 22Delta 1.7% 2.4% 0.2% -1.3% 1.1% -1.7% 1.6% -1.8% -0.7% 2.0% 2.2% 2021 0.9% -2.3% 5.6% -2.2% 5.6% 1.6% -3.4% 3.1% 4.8% 0.0% 13.0% 21Delta 1.0% -3.0% 2.2% -2.3% 3.4% -0.3% -0.2% 0.0% 1.5% 2.1% 3.5% (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2) The benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month. As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nA graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2022 2021 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 43 End Market Performance The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 23.9 % 23.1 % 22.6 % 16.0 % 21.3 % 2021 5.6 % 24.5 % 20.8 % 23.8 % 18.4 % The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 2021 4.9% -30.7% -8.2% -2.3% -11.3% Product Performance From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 24.6 % 21.2 % 18.2 % 9.1 % 18.1 % 2021 4.0 % 28.4 % 20.2 % 24.2 % 18.8 % From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% 2021 6.1% -10.8% 5.1% 9.6% 1.9% Two product lines, safety and janitorial, accounted for approximately 44% of total non-fastener sales in 2022. The pattern in 2021, and particularly the second quarter of 2021, was affected by difficult comparisons versus the prior year, when the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge of safety and janitorial supplies that was not repeated to the same degree in 2022. Setting aside the unique circumstances surrounding the pandemic, our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles. However, we would typically expect it to outperform our fastener business over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% 2021 45.4% 46.5% 46.3% 46.5% 46.2% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.1% in 2022 and 46.2% in 2021, a decrease of 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily related to three factors. First, in 2022 we experienced relatively higher growth from our large and Onsite customers, which tend to have a lower gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. This was only partly offset by favorable product mix resulting from relatively higher growth from our fasteners products during the year, which tend to have a higher gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. Second, in the second half of 2022, we did not pass through pricing sufficient to offset higher costs, which resulted in an adverse impact on our gross margin percentage. Third, in the second half of 2022, we experienced lower product margins for certain categories of our other products. We believe slower demand and greater product availability in the marketplace due to supply chain normalization has put some pressure on products that tend to be sold less frequently by our business units. These factors were mostly offset by a reduction in the amount of pandemic-related write-downs and narrower losses to operate our truck fleet related to our strong freight revenue growth leveraging relatively stable fleet costs.\n44 Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.2% in 2022 from 26.0% in 2021. This reflected a decline, as a percentage of net sales, in employee- and occupancy-related expenses.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 14.7 % 11.6 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 2.6 % 3.9 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 18.5 % 4.9 % Our employee-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher base pay and employment taxes from higher FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation; an increase in bonuses and commissions resulting from improved sales and profitability; and an increase in our profit sharing contribution. This was partly offset by a decline in health insurance costs, as the use of medical services by employees normalized following the post-pandemic catch-up activity in 2021. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Selling personnel (1) 7.9% 1.7% Distribution/Transportation personnel 8.4% 5.8% Manufacturing personnel 12.4% 2.0% Organizational support personnel (2) 9.5% 7.4% Total personnel 8.3% 2.8% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; slightly higher depreciation related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; and slightly higher facility costs, with higher utility costs being only partly offset by lower rents stemming from branch consolidations.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs related to selling-related transportation, including higher fuel costs; higher spending on information technology; higher spending on travel, meals, and supplies; and higher general insurance expense. These elements were only partly offset by lower bad debt expense.\nNet Interest Expense Our net interest expense was $13.6 in 2022 compared to $9.6 in 2021. We carried higher average debt balances in 2022 relative to the prior year, and specifically higher balances of variable rate credit facility debt, as a result of high sustained working capital needs and an increase in share buybacks. We also incurred higher average interest rates during the year due to changes in interest levels in the marketplace.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $282.8 in 2021, or 23.4% of earnings before income taxes. The increase in our tax rate in 2022 is due primarily to reduced benefits associated with the exercise of stock options, an increase in state income tax expense, and an absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited 2021.\n45 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 1,086.9 925.0 Basic EPS 1.89 1.61 Diluted EPS 1.89 1.60 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Net earnings 17.5 % 7.7 % Basic EPS 17.7 % 7.5 % Diluted EPS 17.8 % 7.4 % 2022 2021 Tax Rate 24.5 % 23.4 % During 2022, net earnings increased, primarily due to higher sales and our ability in the period to grow costs more slowly than we grew sales. This was only slightly offset by a higher income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash provided $ 941.0 770.1 % of net earnings 86.6% 83.3% In 2022, we experienced a slight increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, though this reflects a significant increase in our conversion percentage in the second half of 2022 which more than offset a significant decline in our conversion percentage in the first half of 2022. Taken as a whole, while our working capital needs remained elevated through 2022, they declined slightly on a year-over-year basis whereas our earnings increased on a year-over-year basis.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2022 2022 2022 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,013.2 113.0 12.6% Inventories 1,708.0 184.4 12.1% Trade working capital $ 2,721.2 297.4 12.3% Accounts payable $ 255.0 21.9 9.4% Trade working capital, net $ 2,466.2 275.5 12.6% Net sales in last three months $ 1,695.6 969.8 16.1% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2022, the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflected several factors. First, our receivables are expanding due to improved business activity and resulting growth in our customers' sales. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our customer mix due to relatively stronger sales growth from national account customers, which tend to be larger and carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. 46 In 2022, our inventories increased, reflecting significant inflation in the value of stocked parts, the addition of inventory to support the growth of our manufacturing and construction customers as they expand production to meet improved business activity, deeper inventory stocking due to disruption in supply chains, and our efforts to sustain higher internal fulfillment rates. In 2022, the annual growth in accounts payable reflected product purchases increasing to support the improvement in business activity at our manufacturing and construction customers.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2022 2021 Selling locations 58% 57% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 42% 43% Total 100% 100% Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash used $ 163.0 148.5 % of net earnings 15.0% 16.1% The changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was primarily related to higher net capital expenditures. Set forth below is a recap of our 2022 and 2021 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2022 2021 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 97.8 70.3 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 21.5 11.0 Data processing software and equipment 30.6 28.0 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 12.4 37.9 Vehicles 11.5 9.4 Purchases of property and equipment 173.8 156.6 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (11.4) (8.4) Net capital expenditures 162.4 148.2 % of net sales 2.3% 2.5% % of net earnings 14.9% 16.0% Our net capital expenditures increased in 2022, when compared to 2021. The most significant area driving this increase was higher spending on FMI equipment. We had slightly higher property spending, which reflected significant investments in automation and upgrades at our hubs mostly offset by lower spending on a new building in downtown Winona, which was completed in 2021. We had only modest increases related to our vehicle fleet, manufacturing operations, and information technology. Net capital expenditures in 2022 were below our anticipated range of $170.0 to $190.0 due to certain equipment and project delays related to hub projects.\n47 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities were due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases. These amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments (proceeds) from debt obligations. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Cash dividends paid $ 711.3 643.7 % of net earnings 65.4% 69.6% Purchases of common stock 237.8 — % of net earnings 21.9% —% Total returned to shareholders $ 949.1 643.7 % of net earnings 87.3% 69.6% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (9.2) (31.6) % of net earnings -0.8% -3.4% Debt obligations (proceeds) payments, net $ (165.0) 15.0 % of net earnings -15.2% 1.6% Net cash used $ 774.9 627.1 % of net earnings 71.3% 67.8% Stock Purchases In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share. In 2021, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe had authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization did not have an expiration date.\nDividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on January 18, 2023. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24. In 2021, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.12.\nDebt Our borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2022 as follows: Peak borrowings 2022 First quarter $ 525.0 Second quarter 595.0 Third quarter 650.0 Fourth quarter 710.0 Effects of Inflation In 2022, we began to observe easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping). However, this did not translate into a reduction in inflationary pressures on our financial results for two reasons. First, inflationary pressures accelerated through 2021, and many periods in 2022 were comparing to lower cost levels in the preceding year. Second, we have a long supply chain for many products, and it can take several quarters from when inflationary pressures begin to recede for the effect to impact our earnings results. In 2022, we increased prices, sought alternative sources for products and services, and consolidated spend for products and services as a means of mitigating inflation. However, higher product and transportation costs did have a slightly negative effect on our gross margin percentage for the full year. 48 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Inventories, are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following: Allowance for Credit Losses – This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nInventory valuation – Adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels, sales information, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory, or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nGeneral insurance reserves – These reserves are for general claims related to workers' compensation, property and casualty losses, and other general liability self-insured losses. The reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends. We perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels. We analyze historical trends, claims experience, and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, if any, is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity steel pricing, commodity energy prices, and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows: Import shipping costs – We import a significant quantity of our products, particularly fasteners and private label products, from foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. As a result, we incur costs related to shipping charges, duties, harbor fees, and sundry other expenses involved in the movement of product for sale in North America and our other global locations. These costs are embedded in our product values, and significant fluctuations can affect our product gross profit depending on what mitigating actions might be taken. The most significant contributor to these fluctuations is the cost of overseas shipping containers. During 2023, the cost of overseas shipping containers was below the prior year. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to import shipping costs was $23.0 to $28.0 in 2023. Commodity steel prices – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. During 2023, the price of steel as reflected in many market indexes has been below prior year levels, though in most cases price levels have stabilized in recent periods and the rate of decline is moderating. Due to our long supply chain, changes in the cost of steel can take a number of quarters to be reflected in our financial results. Further, the cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the steel products that we sell, which can also diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity steel prices was immaterial in 2023.\nCommodity energy prices – We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity. As reflected in many market indexes, energy prices during 2023 were generally below prior year levels, which contributed to lower costs for fuel consumed in our vehicles and lower utility costs at our facilities. Total direct fuel consumption is a relatively minor cost to the company and, as a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity energy prices was immaterial in 2023. Fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell. During 2023, prices for fossil fuels were generally below prior year levels. The cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the products that we sell, which can diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. As a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to materials for which fossil fuels are a feedstock was immaterial in 2023.\nForeign currency exchange rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments, our operations in countries other than the U.S., and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material. We estimate the effect on our sales and net earnings related to changes in foreign exchange rates was $18.7 and immaterial, respectively, in 2023.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates. As a result, changes in such rates can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage point increase to our floating rate debt in 2023 would have resulted in approximately $0.6 of additional interest expense. A description of our Credit Facility is contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 ITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Fastenal Company: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fastenal Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II — valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n51 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of audit evidence over inventory quantities at in-market locations As disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet, the Company held $1,522.7 million of inventory, the majority of which was held at 3,419 in-market locations, as of December 31, 2023. The Company's processes to track and determine consolidated inventory relies on a perpetual inventory system which involves the interaction of information technology (IT) systems.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the quantities of inventory at in-market locations as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over quantities of inventory at in-market locations required challenging auditor judgment to assess the number of in-market locations visited and included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge due to the interaction of IT systems that track physical inventory quantities by location.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included IT application controls, as well as certain controls related to access to programs and data, program changes, and computer operations. It also included certain controls related to the Company's physical inventory cycle counts. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing certain IT controls, inclusive of the interface of IT systems, which support the Company's perpetual inventory system. We applied auditor judgment in the determination of the locations to test the Company's inventory quantities by evaluating: • Homogeneity of the locations; • Historical inventory locations we have visited and results of prior physical counts; • Inventory dollars by location; and • The Company's inventory cycle count results, including the results of monitoring and compliance with cycle count program by in-market location.\nWe tested the existence and completeness of inventory by counting inventory quantities on a sample basis through in-market location visits during the year to evaluate the Company's perpetual inventory records. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over the quantities of inventory at in-market locations.\n/s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.

Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Overview Fastenal is a leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of branches and Onsite locations. Collectively, we refer to our branches and Onsite locations as in-market locations. We have more than 3,400 in-market locations located primarily in North America.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fastenal Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, referred to as Fastenal or by terms such as we, our, or us). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns and any related sales incentives. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when or as we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by transferring control of the promised products to the customer, with the majority of revenue recognized at the point in time the customer obtains control of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Using probability assessments, which are based on known inputs at year-end, we estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the contract. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation and are short term in nature. Sales taxes and value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.\nAccounts Receivable Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions The functional currency of our foreign operations is typically the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into United States dollars for balance sheet accounts, except retained earnings, using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, for retained earnings at historical exchange rates, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the applicable period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders' equity captioned accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in cost of sales or operating and administrative expenses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories Inventories, consisting of finished goods merchandise held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value. We record valuation adjustments for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory that are equal to the difference between the cost and estimated net realizable value for that inventory. These estimates are based on a review and comparison of the current inventory levels to projected and historical sales of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided for using the straight-line method over the anticipated economic useful lives of the related property.\nLeases We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, the current portion of operating lease liabilities, and the operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 The ROU assets represent our right to control the use of an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent, taxes, and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area or other maintenance costs) which are accounted for as a single lease component as we have elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components for all leases. Our pick-up truck leases typically have a non-cancelable lease term of less than one year and therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to exclude these short-term leases from our ROU assets and lease liabilities. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at our sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. We regularly evaluate the renewal options and when they are reasonably certain of exercise, we include the renewal period in our lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. We have a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment, we apply a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid deposits, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets, and are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as necessary. There were no impairments recorded during any of the three years reported in these consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nInsurance Reserves We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, health, and general liability costs. Specific stop-loss coverage is provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Self-insurance liabilities are based on our estimate of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nProduct Warranties We offer a basic limited warranty for certain of our products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. We typically recoup these costs through product warranties we hold with the original equipment manufacturers. Our warranty expense has historically been minimal.\nStock-Based Compensation We estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in operating and administrative expenses. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 59 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options considered to be 'in-the-money' (i.e., when the market price of our stock is greater than the exercise price of our outstanding stock options).\nSegment Reporting We have determined that for our North American regions we meet the aggregation criteria outlined in the accounting standards as these regions have similar: (1) economic characteristics, (2) products and services, (3) customers, (4) distribution channels, and (5) regulatory environments. Considering our operations outside of North America represent less than 10% of our net sales, net earnings, or assets, we report as a single business segment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reporting requirements under Topic 280. The enhanced disclosure requirements include: title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), significant segment expenses provided to the CODM, extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarifying single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, and permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain circumstances. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply retrospectively to all periods presented.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. The new guidance requires consistent categorization and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as further disaggregation of income taxes paid. This change is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply on a prospective basis to annual financial statements for periods beginning after the effective date. However, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 60 Note 2. Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue The accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the selling location from which the sale occurred.

Stockholders' Equity Dividends On January 17, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share of common stock to be paid in cash on February 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.78, which included a special, one-time dividend of $0.38 per share. We paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.24 and $1.12 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Options Effective January 2, 2024, the compensation committee of our board of directors granted to our employees options to purchase a total of 764,195 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. On the same date, certain of our non-employee directors received options to acquire a total of 50,717 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. The closing stock price on the effective date of the grants was $63.55 per share.\nThe following tables summarize the details of options granted under our stock option plans that were still outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and the assumptions used to value those grants. All such grants were effective at the close of business on the date of grant.\nOptions Granted Option Exercise Price Closing Stock Price on Date of Grant December 31, 2023 Date of Grant Options Outstanding Options Exercisable January 3, 2023 1,071,943 $ 48.00 $ 47.400 989,048 70,562 January 3, 2022 713,438 $ 62.00 $ 61.980 611,848 53,355 January 4, 2021 741,510 $ 48.00 $ 47.650 591,206 211,323 January 2, 2020 902,263 $ 38.00 $ 37.230 658,884 322,242 January 2, 2019 1,316,924 $ 26.00 $ 25.705 758,611 451,061 January 2, 2018 1,087,936 $ 27.50 $ 27.270 541,026 419,460 January 3, 2017 1,529,578 $ 23.50 $ 23.475 523,828 426,290 April 19, 2016 1,690,880 $ 23.00 $ 22.870 245,075 188,177 April 21, 2015 1,786,440 $ 21.00 $ 20.630 54,552 54,552 Total 10,840,912 4,974,078 2,197,022 Date of Grant Risk-free Interest Rate Expected Life of Option in Years Expected Dividend Yield Expected Stock Volatility Estimated Fair Value of Stock Option January 3, 2023 4.0% 5.00 2.6% 29.58% $ 11.62 January 3, 2022 1.3% 5.00 1.7% 28.52% $ 13.68 January 4, 2021 0.4% 5.00 2.0% 29.17% $ 9.57 January 2, 2020 1.7% 5.00 2.4% 25.70% $ 6.81 January 2, 2019 2.5% 5.00 2.9% 23.96% $ 4.40 January 2, 2018 2.2% 5.00 2.3% 23.45% $ 5.02 January 3, 2017 1.9% 5.00 2.6% 24.49% $ 4.20 April 19, 2016 1.3% 5.00 2.6% 26.34% $ 4.09 April 21, 2015 1.3% 5.00 2.7% 26.84% $ 3.68 All of the options in the tables above vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years. Generally, each option will terminate approximately 10 years after the grant date.\nThe fair value of each share-based option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the assumptions listed above. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the time of grant. The expected life is the average length of time over which we expect the employee groups will exercise their options, net of forfeitures, which is based on historical experience with similar grants. The dividend yield is estimated over the expected life of the option based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends. Expected stock volatilities are based on the movement of our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 63 A summary of activities under our stock option plans consisted of the following: Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2023 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Granted 1,071,943 $ 48.00 9.00 Exercised (1,170,693) $ 25.69 Cancelled/forfeited (301,908) $ 45.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 4,974,078 $ 38.70 5.99 Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 2,197,022 $ 30.88 4.54 Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2022 5,173,270 $ 30.23 6.08 Granted 713,438 $ 62.00 9.00 Exercised (346,992) $ 26.78 Cancelled/forfeited (164,980) $ 40.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 2,437,636 $ 27.14 4.30 (1) Weighted average exercise price.\n(2) Weighted average remaining contractual life in years.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $38.1, $10.2, and $38.8, respectively. The intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the underlying shares at the date of exercise. At December 31, 2023, there was $16.6 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options granted under the employee stock option plan. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.18 years. Any future change in estimated forfeitures will impact this amount. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested under our employee stock option plan during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $5.3, $5.2, and $4.8, respectively.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option plan was $7.3, $7.2, and $5.6 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nShares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year 570,811,674 575,464,682 574,159,575 Stock options exercised 1,170,693 346,992 1,305,107 Purchases of common stock — (5,000,000) — Balance at end of year 571,982,367 570,811,674 575,464,682 Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 64 Earnings Per Share The following tables present a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share and a summary of the options to purchase shares of common stock which were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive: Reconciliation 2023 2022 2021 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 571,271,846 573,777,790 574,808,030 Weighted shares assumed upon exercise of stock options 1,736,762 1,845,324 2,309,026 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 573,008,608 575,623,114 577,117,056 Summary of Anti-dilutive Options Excluded 2023 2022 2021 Options to purchase shares of common stock 1,568,460 1,335,898 678,310 Weighted average exercise prices of options $ 53.80 55.25 48.00 Any dilutive impact summarized above related to periods when the average market price of our stock exceeded the exercise price of the potentially dilutive stock options then outstanding.\nNote 6. Retirement Savings Plan The Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan covers all of our employees in the United States. Our employees in Canada may participate in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The general purpose of both of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings contributions. In addition to the participation of our employees, we make annual profit sharing contributions based on an established formula. The expense recorded under this profit sharing formula was approximately $23.1, $22.1, and $17.4 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Note 7.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $9.2 as of December 31, 2023 and $8.6 as of December 31, 2022. We believe it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $1.4 in unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2024 as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations. The 2023 and 2022 liability is included in deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, all states, and various local and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before 2020 in the case of United States federal examinations, and with limited exception, before 2018 in the case of foreign, state, and local examinations.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of our approximately $514.7 of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 66 Note 8. Operating Leases We lease space under non-cancelable operating leases for several distribution centers, several manufacturing locations, and certain branch locations. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. We also lease certain semi-tractors, pick-up trucks, and computer equipment under operating leases. Certain operating leases for pick-up trucks contain residual value guarantee provisions which would generally become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. The aggregate residual value guarantee related to these leases was approximately $118.4.

The Credit Facility includes a committed letter of credit subfacility of $55.0. Any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility for which we have the ability and intent to pay using cash within the next 12 months will be classified as a current liability. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants, and our right to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our compliance with these covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus a 0.10% spread adjustment plus 0.95%.

Legal Contingencies We are involved in certain legal actions, including those that are ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. We record a liability for these legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. As of December 31, 2023, there were no litigation matters that we consider to be probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse outcome.\nNote 11. Subsequent Events We evaluated all subsequent event activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of the dividend declaration and stock option activities disclosed in Note 5.\n***End of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements*** Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 69 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Securities Exchange Act)). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The attestation report required under Item 9A is contained earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading 'Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. The company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. There was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ Daniel L.

The corporation may have other offices in such places within or outside of Minnesota as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.\nARTICLE II SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS Section 1. Place. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation, or at such other place within or outside of Minnesota as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation; provided, however, that any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the corporation is located. The Board of Directors may determine that shareholders not physically present in person or by proxy at a shareholder meeting may, by means of remote communication, participate in a shareholder meeting held at a designated place. The Board of Directors also may determine that a meeting of the shareholders shall not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by means of remote communication. Participation by remote communication constitutes presence at the meeting.\nSection 2. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the shareholders shall be held annually, as soon as convenient after the close of the preceding fiscal year of the corporation, at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, for the election of directors and the transaction of other appropriate business.\nSection 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time and for any purpose or purposes by a shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that purpose, must be called by twenty-five percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote) or by the Chair of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or two or more directors. The business transacted at a special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.\nSection 4. Notice. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of shareholders, stating the date, time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which it is called, shall be given to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. Notice to a shareholder is also effectively given if the notice is addressed to the shareholder or a group of shareholders in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), so long as the corporation has first received the written or implied consent required by those rules and regulations.\nSection 5. Waiver; Objections. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting, including attendance by means of remote communication, is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.\nSection 6. Quorum; Adjourned Meetings. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of shareholders originally present leaves less than a quorum. The Chair of any meeting of shareholders may adjourn the meeting, for any reason and whether or not a quorum is present, to a time and place announced at the time of adjournment, and no further notice of the adjourned meeting shall be required.\nExhibit 3.2 Section 7. Voting and Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, every owner of shares entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy and shall have one vote for each share held. In electing directors, the voting shall be by ballot. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote (a) by filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the corporation or the corporation's duly authorized agent at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original. Any shareholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors.\nSection 8. Chair of Meeting; Conduct of Meetings. The Chair of the Board shall preside at all meetings of shareholders. In his or her absence, the Board of Directors may appoint any other officer or director to act as Chair at the meeting. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate, or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the Chair of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such Chair are necessary, appropriate, or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the Chair shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants, regulation of the opening and closing of the polls, and restricting the use of cell phones, audio, or video recording devices and similar devices at the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the Chair, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. Section 9. Advance-Notice Requirements.\nSubdivision 1. Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with this Section 9 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures of this Section 9 or (iii) by any Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 10 below) who complies with the requirements of Section 10 below.\nSubdivision 2. Business Conducted at Meetings. The business conducted at any special meeting of shareholders of the corporation shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the special meeting pursuant to Section 3 of this Article II. At any regular meeting of shareholders of the corporation, the proposal of business (other than the nomination and election of directors, which shall be subject to Subdivision 1 of this Section 9) to be considered by the shareholders may be made (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of the meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures of this Section 9, or (iv) by a shareholder or group of shareholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nSubdivision 3. Timing and Content of Notice. (a) Timing of Notice. Timely written notice of a nomination or proposal pursuant to this Section 9 must be given to the General Counsel of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's written notice of nominations or of proposals, in each case to be made at a regular meeting of shareholders (other than business proposed pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act), must be delivered in writing to the General Counsel of the corporation, or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation, not less than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's regular meeting of shareholders. If, however, the date of the regular meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by a shareholder shall be timely only if so delivered or so mailed and received not less than 90 days before such regular meeting or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of the date of such regular meeting. If a special meeting of shareholders is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors, a shareholder’s written notice of nominations to be made at the special meeting of shareholders must be delivered in writing to the General Counsel of the corporation, or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation, not less than 90 days before the meeting (or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) the date of the meeting). Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the adjournment of a meeting of shareholders shall not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.\n(b) Content of Notice. A shareholder's notice to the corporation of nominations or of a proposal for a meeting of shareholders shall set forth: (x) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (i) such person's name, (ii) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or that is otherwise required, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, and (iii) such person's written consent to being named in any proxy materials as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (y) as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting (other than the nomination of a director): (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and (ii) any material interest in such business of the shareholder or any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (z) as to the shareholder giving the notice: (i) the name and address of such shareholder and of any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (ii) the class or series (if any) and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such shareholder or any such beneficial owner, (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into by, or on behalf of, such shareholder or any such beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk, or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of such shareholder or any such beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, (iv) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors (in the case of a nomination) or entitled to vote at the meeting (in the case of a shareholder proposal), will continue to be a holder of record of shares entitled to vote for the election of directors or at the meeting, as the case may be, through the date of the meeting, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice or to make the proposal, and (v) a representation whether the shareholder or any such beneficial owner intends or is part of a group that intends to deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding shares required to adopt the proposal (other than the nomination of a director) or otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of the proposal. A shareholder who intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the corporation's director nominees and who has delivered a notice of nomination pursuant to this Section 9 shall promptly certify to the corporation, and notify the corporation in writing, that it has complied with or will comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, and upon request of the corporation, shall, not later than five business days prior to the date of the applicable meeting of shareholders, deliver to the corporation reasonable evidence of such compliance.\nAt the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the General Counsel of the corporation all completed and signed questionnaires required of the corporation's directors and any other information required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice of nomination that pertains to a nominee.\n(c) Consequences of Failure to Give Timely Notice. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation and no business shall be conducted at any regular meeting except in accordance with this Section 9 or Section 10 below. The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance with this Section 9 or Section 10 below and, if the Chair should so determine, the Chair shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded or any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 9 and, if the Chair so determines, the defective nomination shall be disregarded. Unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act and (ii) subsequently (A) notifies the corporation that such shareholder no longer intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the corporation's Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) director nominees in accordance with Rule 14a-19, (B) fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19, or (C) fails to provide reasonable evidence sufficient to satisfy the corporation that such requirements have been met, then such shareholder's nominations shall be deemed null and void and the corporation shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for any nominee proposed by such shareholder.\n(d) Inapplicable in Certain Circumstances. This Section 9 does not apply to any shareholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The requirements, procedures, and notice deadlines of Rule 14a-8 shall govern any proposal made pursuant thereto.\nSubdivision 4. Public Announcement. For purposes of this Section 9 and Section 10 below, \"public announcement\" means disclosure (i) when made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service, (ii) when filed in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) when mailed as the notice of the meeting pursuant to Section 4 of this Article II.\nSubdivision 5.

Eligible Shareholder. For purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder and satisfying the Ownership requirements under Subdivision 1: (a) The outstanding shares of common stock Owned by one or more shareholders and beneficial owners that each shareholder and/or beneficial owner has Owned continuously for at least three (3) years as of (i) the date on which the Shareholder Notice is delivered to the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation in accordance with this Section 10, (ii) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the regular meeting, and (iii) the date of the regular meeting may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and beneficial owners whose Ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20) and that any and all requirements and obligations for an Eligible Shareholder set forth in this Section 10 are satisfied by and as to each such shareholder and beneficial owner (except as noted with respect to aggregation or as otherwise provided in Subdivision 3); (b) For this purpose, two or more funds that are (i) under common management and investment control, (ii) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer, or (iii) a \"group of Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) investment companies,\" as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (each, a \"Qualifying Fund\"), shall be treated as one shareholder or beneficial owner; and (c) No shareholder or beneficial owner, alone or together with any of its affiliates, may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Subdivision 2. If a group of shareholders aggregates Ownership of shares in order to meet the requirements under this Subdivision 2, (i) all shares held by each shareholder constituting their contribution to the foregoing three percent (3%) threshold must have been held by that shareholder continuously for at least three (3) years and through the date of the regular meeting, and evidence of such continuous Ownership shall be provided as specified in Subdivision 5, (ii) each provision in this Section 10 that requires the Eligible Shareholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each shareholder (including each individual fund) that is a member of such group to provide such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate their shareholdings in order to meet the three percent (3%) Ownership requirement of the Required Shares definition), (iii) a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section 10 by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Shareholder and (iv) such Ownership shall be determined by aggregating the lowest number of shares continuously Owned by each such shareholder during the required holding period and the Shareholder Notice must indicate, for each such shareholder, such lowest number of shares continuously owned by such shareholder during such period.\nSubdivision 3. Ownership. For purposes of this Section 10: (a) A shareholder or beneficial owner shall be deemed to \"Own\" only those outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation as to which such person possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) shall not include any shares (A) sold by such person or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (B) borrowed by such person or any of its affiliates for any purposes, (C) purchased by such person or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (D) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such person or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised would have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such person's or its affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree any gain or loss realized or realizable from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such person or its affiliate.\n(b) A shareholder or beneficial owner shall \"Own\" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the person retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person's Ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (i) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on no more than three (3) business days' notice and such shares are recalled prior to the final date of the Shareholder Notice pursuant to Subdivision 6 or (ii) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. Provided the Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee will be included in the corporation's proxy materials subject to the terms herein; such recalled shares shall remain recalled (and otherwise 'owned' as defined herein) through the regular meeting.\n(c) The terms \"Owned,\" \"Owning\" and other variations of the word \"Own\" shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation are \"Owned\" for purposes of this Subdivision 3 shall be determined by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the corporation and its shareholders. For purposes of this Subdivision 3, the term \"affiliate\" or \"affiliates\" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nSubdivision 4. Required Information. For purposes of this Section 10, the \"Required Information\" that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is: Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) (a) The information concerning each Shareholder Nominee and the applicable Eligible Shareholder that is required to be disclosed in the corporation's proxy statement by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and (b) If the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a written statement of the Eligible Shareholder, not to exceed 500 words, in support of each Shareholder Nominee, which must be provided at the same time as the Shareholder Notice for inclusion in the corporation's proxy statement for the regular meeting (the \"Statement\"); provided that only one Statement may be submitted by any Eligible Shareholder, including any group of shareholders together constituting an Eligible Shareholder.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or listing standard. Nothing in this Section 10 shall limit the corporation's ability to solicit against and include in its proxy materials its own statements relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee.\nSubdivision 5. Information to be Provided by Eligible Shareholder.

Section 302A.441 of the MBCA also provides that action may be taken by shareholders without a meeting only by unanimous written consent. The By-Laws provide an advance written notice procedure with respect to shareholder proposals of business and shareholder nominations of candidates for election as directors. Shareholders at an annual meeting are able to consider only the proposals and nominations specified in the notice of meeting or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a shareholder that has delivered timely written notice in proper form to the Company's general counsel of the business to be brought before the meeting.\nControl Share Provision Section 302A.671 of the MBCA applies, with certain exceptions, to any acquisition of the Company's Voting Stock (from a person other than the Company and other than in connection with certain mergers and exchanges to which the Company is a party) resulting in the acquiring person owning 20% or more of the Company's Voting Stock then outstanding. Section 302A.671 requires approval of any such acquisitions by both (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, including shares held by the acquiring person, and (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, excluding all interested shares. In general, shares acquired in the absence of such approval are denied voting rights and are redeemable at their then fair market value by the Company within 30 days after the acquiring person has failed to give a timely information statement to the Company or the date the shareholders voted not to grant voting rights to the acquiring person's shares. The control share provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or in its bylaws approved by its shareholders. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nBusiness Combination Provision Section 302A.673 of the MBCA generally prohibits the Company or any of its subsidiaries from entering into any merger, share exchange, sale of material assets or similar transaction with a 10% shareholder within four years following the date the person became a 10% shareholder, unless either the transaction or the person's acquisition of shares is approved prior to the person becoming a 10% shareholder by a committee of all of the disinterested members of the board of directors. The business combination provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or its bylaws. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nTakeover Offer; Fair Price Under Section 302A.675 of the MBCA, an offeror may not acquire shares of a publicly held corporation within two years following the last purchase of shares pursuant to a takeover offer with respect to that class, including acquisitions made by purchase, exchange, merger, consolidation, partial or complete liquidation, redemption, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, or any other similar transaction, unless (i) the acquisition is approved by a committee of the board's disinterested directors before the purchase of any shares by the offeror pursuant to the earlier takeover offer, or (ii) shareholders are afforded, at the time of the proposed acquisition, a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the shares to the offeror upon substantially equivalent terms as those provided in the earlier takeover offer.\nGreenmail Restrictions Under Section 302A.553 of the MBCA, a corporation is prohibited from buying shares at an above-market price from a greater than 5% shareholder who has held the shares for less than two years unless (i) the purchase is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote or (ii) the corporation makes an equal or better offer to all shareholders for all other shares of that class or series and any other class or series into which they may be converted.\nAuthority of the Board of Directors The Company's board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of the Company's capital stock, including the authority to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock, setting forth the designation of each such series and fixing the relative rights and preferences for each such series, without seeking shareholder approval in most instances. In addition, under the By-Laws, the Company's board of directors has the right to fill vacancies of the board of directors (including a vacancy created by an increase in the size of the board of directors).\nFastenal Company Bonus Program for Executive Officers Quarterly Incentives Our executive officers are eligible for cash incentives through individual bonus arrangements based on improvements in the overall financial performance of the company and/or their respective areas of responsibility. The bonus arrangements provide our executive officers with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus for each quarter during a year when we increase our earnings above a predetermined minimum target. The primary cash bonuses for all of our named executive officers are based on growth in pre-tax earnings of the company and/ or the officer's area of responsibility. The compensation committee selected pre-tax earnings as the appropriate metric for calculating cash bonuses for those officers because of the committee's belief that the focus of the named executive officers should be on profitability, which is the primary driver of shareholder value. The cash bonus for our chief financial officer also includes a component based on growth in company-wide net earnings because his responsibilities allow him to affect our entire financial position including our tax position. The compensation committee believes that no named executive officer should earn a cash bonus under this program for a quarter unless financial performance has improved and therefore sets minimum targets for each quarter that are equal to the earnings achieved for the same quarter in the prior year. The compensation committee requires growth in earnings before any bonuses can be earned due to its belief that growth is achievable with superior effort and will generate the cash necessary to expand the company's operations in accordance with our business plans and increase shareholder value. The payout percentage used to calculate the amount of each named executive officer's primary quarterly cash bonus reflects the officer's track record in his or her current position (i.e., newly promoted executives historically have had to prove themselves in their new positions before earning higher payout percentages) and relative ability to impact profitability.\nCash bonus payments to our named executive officers are tied directly to our financial performance so that they increase only if and to the extent the company's profitability grows; therefore, we do not believe it is necessary for payouts under our primary executive cash incentive program to be capped. We believe the current design of our executive bonus arrangements, along with our other controls, adequately mitigates risk and the use of multiple metrics would not be in furtherance of our goal of keeping our compensation programs simple, understandable, and transparent, and would risk keeping our executives focused on things other than profitability, thereby depriving them of the clear feedback and motivation necessary to improve our bottom line. Therefore, we do not base these cash incentives on multiple metrics. Our named executive officers are each eligible for a supplemental bonus program. The supplemental bonus program, known as the ROA (Return on Assets) Plan, is intended to encourage better management of accounts receivable, inventory, and vehicles and provides cash incentive amounts on a quarterly basis for asset management improvement over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and is described in more detail below. Exhibit 10.1 2023 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2023 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2022. Consistent with prior years, the bonuses for 2023 were based on growth in pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility. The bonuses for each quarter were determined by applying a payout percentage to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings exceeded 100% of pre-tax earnings or net earnings for the same quarter in 2022. The compensation committee determined that the payout percentages for each of the named executive officers for 2023 would remain unchanged from those in effect at the end of 2022, except that Mr. Lewis' bonus arrangement was updated to include a component for growth in pre-tax earnings, in addition to growth in net earnings. In May 2023, when Mr. Watts was appointed to Chief Sales Officer, his bonus arrangement was updated to reflect growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings. Prior to May 2023, his bonus arrangement included growth in pre-tax earnings of our international business units and a smaller component of company-wide pre-tax growth.\nThe specific bonus opportunities for our named executive officers are summarized in the table below. Each named executive officer's cash bonus for each quarter during 2023 was determined by applying the payout percentage listed opposite his or her name below to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility for that quarter exceeded 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022 (the 'minimum target'). Name Earnings Type Payout Percentage Mr. Florness Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.75% Mr. Lewis Company-wide pre-tax earnings / Company-wide net earnings 0.50% / 0.35% Mr. Miller (1) Pre-tax earnings 1.00% / 0.25% Mr. Watts (2) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% Mr. Soderberg Company-wide pre-tax earnings 0.65% Mr. Owen (3) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% (1) The bonuses for Mr. Miller were based on growth in pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (Eastern United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 1.00%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.25%.\n(2) Prior to May 2023, the bonuses for Mr. Watts were based on growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (which were all areas outside of the United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 2.20%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.30%. (3) Mr. Owen resigned on October 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets out, for each quarter in 2023, our actual and minimum target pre-tax earnings and net earnings on a company-wide basis for that quarter, in each case rounded to the nearest thousand. (As indicated above, the 'minimum target' amount in 2023 was 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022.) 2023 Actual Pre-tax Earnings Minimum Target Pre-tax Earnings Actual Net Earnings Minimum Target Net Earnings First quarter $ 389,734,000 $ 355,714,000 $ 295,139,000 $ 269,588,000 Second quarter 392,640,000 380,745,000 298,050,000 287,102,000 Third quarter 385,389,000 375,316,000 295,367,000 284,595,000 Fourth quarter 354,226,000 328,177,000 266,429,000 245,606,000 During 2023, the approximate percentage of the actual and minimum pre-tax earnings of the company attributable to our operations in the geographic area under Mr. Miller's leadership was 47% and Mr. Watts' leadership through April was 13%. As noted above, the ROA Plan, which is designed to encourage careful management of assets, namely accounts receivable, inventories, and pick-up trucks, for 2023 was approved by the compensation committee for our named executive officers. Quarterly bonuses would be payable pursuant to the ROA Plan if a specified level of improvement in asset management relative to the comparable prior year quarter was achieved. Improvement in asset management was assessed using a two-quarter average of total assets divided by the trailing 12-month net sales, which we refer to as the 'performance percentage.' If the performance percentage when compared to the prior year benchmark showed improvement at a level specified in the table below, the named executive officer would receive the corresponding bonus amount. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout 150 basis points $ 15,000 100 basis points (but less than 150 basis points) $ 10,000 50 basis points (but less than 100 basis points) $ 5,000 In addition, for each whole percentage improvement (e.g., 41.0%, 40.0%, 39.0%, etc.) a $10,000 bonus would be payable for the quarter when the new whole percentage threshold was first achieved. We achieved improvement and paid bonus amounts to our named executive officers, pursuant to the ROA Plan for each quarter in fiscal 2023 as follows: 2023 Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout First quarter 150 basis points $ 15,000 Second quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Third quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter Whole percentage improvement (38.0% and 37.0%) 20,000 Total $ 80,000 2024 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2024 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2023. The bonus plans for our named executive officers for 2024 are unchanged from our 2023 bonus plans, except that Mr. Miller's payout percentage on pretax earnings will decrease beginning in the third quarter of 2024 while the geographic area that his bonus will be based on (United States) will increase. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Exhibit 10.2 FASTENAL COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (As amended and restated effective April 24, 2018) This Plan is adopted and made by Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation with principal offices at Winona, Minnesota (the \"Company\"), for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 1. Purpose.\nThe Fastenal Company Stock Option Plan (the \"Plan\") is intended to advance the interests of the Company, its shareholders, and its subsidiaries by encouraging and enabling selected employees upon whose judgment, initiative and effort the Company and its subsidiaries are dependent for the successful conduct of their business, to acquire and retain a proprietary interest in the Company by ownership of its Shares. All Options granted under the Plan and all Shares sold upon exercise of Options are granted and sold by the Company. Options granted under the Plan will not be options that meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"). 2. Definitions.\n(a) \"Administrator\" means the body administering the Plan, as specified in Section 9. (b) \"Board\" means the Board of Directors of the Company. (c) \"Cause\" means (i) any failure by an Optionee to materially conform to the Company's Standards of Conduct; (ii) an Optionee's continued failure or refusal to perform his or her duties to Company or any Subsidiary (except when prevented by reason of illness, disability or approved leave of absence); (iii) an Optionee willfully engaging in conduct that is, in the good faith judgment of the Board or Administrator, demonstrably and materially detrimental to the Company or any Subsidiary, financially, reputationally, or otherwise; (iv) an illegal or negligent act by an Optionee that adversely affects the Company or any Subsidiary in a material way; or (v) conviction of an Optionee of a felony involving moral turpitude. For purposes of this Plan, if an Optionee's termination of employment occurs for any reason other than Cause, and the Company thereafter discovers additional facts that the Company was not aware of as of the date of termination that would have justified a termination of employment for Cause, and if the Administrator provides the Optionee with written notice stating the newly discovered facts that support a termination for Cause within 90 days after the applicable date of termination, then the Optionee's termination of employment will be deemed for all purposes under this Plan to be a termination of employment for Cause.\n(d) \"Company\" means Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation, and any successor corporation. (e) \"Common Stock\" means the Company's $.01 par value Common Stock. (f) \"Date of Grant\" means the date on which the Administrator approves the grant of an Option under the Plan, or such later date as may be specified by the Administrator on the date the Administrator approves the grant. (g) \"Exchange Act\" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (h) \"Fair Market Value\" on any date means the per share closing price or last sale price at which Shares were traded on that date or, if no sale of Shares occurred on that date, on the next preceding day on which a sale of Shares occurred, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or such other recognized national securities exchange on which the Shares are then listed and traded. If the Common Stock is not then listed and traded upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall be what the Administrator determines in good faith to be 100% of the fair market value of a Share as of the date in question. This determination by the Administrator shall be binding upon the Optionee and all other persons. (i) \"Option\" means an Option granted under the Plan. (j) \"Option Price\" means the purchase price for each Share subject to an Option as specified in paragraph 6(a) of the Plan. (k) \"Optionee\" means a person to whom an Option, which has not expired, has been granted under the Plan. (l) \"Permitted Transfer\" means a transfer of a Right by will or the laws of descent and distribution. (m) \"Retirement\" means any termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than for Cause, occurring at or after age 60, or at or after completing 25 years or more of continuous employment with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. (n) \"Shares\" shall mean shares of Common Stock, or such other securities or property as may become subject to Options pursuant to an adjustment as provided under Section 7 of the Plan. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (o) \"Subsidiary\" or \"Subsidiaries\" means a subsidiary corporation or corporations of the Company as defined in Section 424 of the Code. (p) \"Successor\" means the legal representative of the estate of a deceased Optionee or the person or persons who acquire the right to exercise an Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of any Optionee. 3. Shares Subject to Options.\nThe aggregate number of authorized and unissued Shares for which Options may be granted and which may be purchased upon the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 11,462,020, subject to adjustment under the provisions of paragraph 7. In the event any Option shall, for any reason, terminate or expire or be surrendered without having been exercised in full, other Options may be granted covering the Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option. The maximum number of Shares subject to Options that may be granted to any one individual under this Plan during any fiscal year of the Company (the \"Maximum Annual Grant\") is 500,000 Shares, subject to adjustment under the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan. 4. Participants.\nAll employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, subject to any criteria, categories, or limitations that may be established by the Administrator from time to time. Criteria for participation may reflect an employee's contribution to the success of the Company, including the employee's responsibility for Company revenues and profits, responsibility for managing other employees, possession of special skills, and length of service. The Administrator shall determine participation, grant Options, and specify the number of Shares subject to each Option. 5. Grant of Options.\nOptions shall be granted to employees eligible to participate in the Plan at such times and in such amounts, consistent with the Plan, as may be determined by the Administrator, as long as Shares remain available for award under the Plan, or until the Plan is terminated as provided herein. 6. Terms and Conditions of Options. All Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement or certificate in such form and with such terms, including any conditions as to exercisability, as the Administrator may from time to time approve consistent with the Plan, subject to the following limitations and conditions: (a) Option Price. The purchase price of each Share subject to an Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant, but shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. (b) Period of Option. The expiration date with respect to each Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant. (c) Vesting of Shareholder Rights. Neither an Optionee nor any transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company until the Option has been exercised and the Shares purchased are properly issued to such Optionee or transferee. (d) Exercise of Option. The date or dates at which each Option will become exercisable and the period during which such Option may be exercised shall be determined and stated by the Administrator in the award agreement or certificate at the time of grant. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, an Option may be exercised only while the Optionee is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, and only if the Optionee has been continuously so employed since the date the Option was granted. (e) Manner of Exercise. Each exercise of an Option shall be in writing, in such form as the Administrator may prescribe, delivered to the Administrator or its designee, specifying the number of Shares being purchased and accompanied by payment of the Option Price for such Shares, by check payable to the Company or in such other manner as the Administrator may prescribe. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (f) Nontransferability of Options. No Option shall be transferable or assignable by an Optionee otherwise than by a Permitted Transfer. Each Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. No Option shall be pledged or hypothecated in any way and no Option shall be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. Any Option held by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such Option immediately prior to its transfer and may be exercised by such transferee as and to the extent that such Option has become exercisable and has not terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the applicable award agreement or certificate. For purposes of any provision of this Plan relating to notice to an Optionee or to the exercisability or termination of an option upon or following the death, disability or termination of employment of an Optionee, the references to \"Optionee\" shall mean the original grantee of an Option and not any transferee. (g) Termination of Employment. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 6(h), 6(i) or 6(j), upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of such termination of employment, and shall to that extent remain exercisable until the earlier of 90 days after the date of such termination of employment or the expiration date of such Option. The granting of an Option to an Optionee does not alter in any way the existing rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries to terminate such person's employment at any time for any reason or for no reason, nor does it confer upon such person any rights or privileges except as specifically provided for in the Plan. (h) Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, then: (1) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted prior to January 1, 2012 shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of Optionee's death, and shall to that extent remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the earlier of 13 months after the date of Optionee's death or the expiration date of such Option. (2) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement or certificate following the Optionee's death, and shall remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the expiration date of such Option.\n(i) Retirement of Optionee. If an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates due to Retirement, then any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall, subject to the following sentence, terminate except to the extent that it is vested and immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of the Optionee's Retirement, and shall to the extent vested remain exercisable until the expiration date of such Option. With respect to any Option granted on or after January 1, 2012, the Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to provide in the applicable award agreement or certificate, either at the time the Option is granted or by amendment to such award agreement or certificate while the Option is outstanding, for the accelerated or continued vesting of such Option upon or following Retirement. (j) Termination for Cause. Upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for Cause, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited. (k) Forfeiture For Breach of Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, if an Optionee who is party to a non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary violates any such agreement in any material respect, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited, and with respect to any exercise of an Option by such Optionee within a 12 month period prior to the occurrence of such violation, the Optionee shall be liable to the Company for the difference between the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Shares acquired upon such exercise and the aggregate exercise price of such Shares. The Optionee shall pay such amount promptly upon demand by the Company. (l) Demotion or Reassignment of Optionee. If at any time before an outstanding Option becomes fully exercisable the Optionee holder of such Option is transferred or reassigned to a position within the Company or any Subsidiary in which, had the Optionee been assigned to such position as of the Date of Grant of such Option, the Optionee would not have been entitled, under the Option award guidelines then being applied by the Administrator, to receive an Option award covering as many Shares as were made subject to the Option actually issued (a \"Demotion\"), then a portion (or all) of the Option will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion determined as follows: Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (1) if no portion of the outstanding Option has become exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then the portion of the Option that will be forfeited as of the effective date of the Demotion shall be equal to the difference between the number of Shares as granted to the Optionee on the Date of Grant and the number of Shares that would have been granted had the Optionee been assigned to such new position as of the Date of Grant under the Option award guidelines then applied by the Administrator. The Option will become exercisable as to the remaining Shares that are not forfeited on a pro rata basis in accordance with the original exercisability schedule; or (2) if a portion of the outstanding Option was exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then it will remain exercisable during the remaining term of the Option, but the portion of the Option not yet exercisable as of the effective date of the Demotion will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion consistent with Section 6(l)(i) above. 7. Adjustments. (a) Except as provided in paragraph 7(c), in the event of a capital adjustment resulting from a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, or a combination or exchange of Shares, the number and kind of Shares subject to the Plan and the Maximum Annual Grant and the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable shall be adjusted consistent with such capital adjustment. The Option price of any Share under each outstanding Option shall be adjusted so that there will be no change in the aggregate purchase price payable upon exercise of the unexercised portion of such Option. The granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reorganizations, reclassifications, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. (b) In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time. (c) In the event of a Reorganization (as hereinafter defined) in which the Company is not the surviving or acquiring company, or in which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization, then: (1) If there is no plan or agreement respecting the Reorganization (\"Reorganization Agreement\") or if the Reorganization Agreement does not specifically provide for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time; or (2) If there is a Reorganization Agreement and if the Reorganization Agreement specifically provides for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then the securities received on account of such Shares shall be subject to the Plan and then-outstanding Options. The Administrator may make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares for the purchase of which Options may be granted under the Plan and for the Maximum Annual Grant. In addition, the Administrator shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end that the interest of the holder of the Option shall, to the extent practicable, be maintained as before the occurrence of such event. Such adjustment in outstanding Options shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Option but with a corresponding adjustment in the Option price per Share. The term \"Reorganization\" as used in this paragraph (c) of this Section 7 shall mean any statutory merger, statutory consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale, pursuant to an agreement with the Company, of securities of the Company pursuant to which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (d) Adjustments and determinations under this Section 7 shall be made by the Administrator as specified herein, and its decisions as to what adjustments or determinations shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 8. Restrictions on Issuing Shares. The exercise of each Option and the issuance of Shares in connection therewith shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the Administrator shall determine in its discretion that the satisfaction of withholding tax or other withholding liabilities, or that the listing, registration, or qualification of any Shares otherwise deliverable upon such exercise upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or that the consent or approval of any regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, such exercise or the delivery or purchase of Shares pursuant thereto, then in any such event, such exercise shall not be effective unless such withholding, listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Administrator. 9. Administration of Plan. (a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board or by a committee of two or more directors of the Company appointed by the Board (the \"Administrator\"). If the Plan is administered by a committee, it shall report all actions taken by it to the Board. In administering the Plan, the Administrator shall be governed by and shall adhere to the provisions of the Plan, including any criteria for eligibility or participation established by the Board from time to time. Subject to the foregoing, the Administrator shall determine eligibility to participate in the Plan, ascertain the number of Shares for which each participant is eligible in accordance with any established criteria, grant Options, construe and interpret the Plan, and make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. All such actions and determinations shall be conclusively binding for all purposes and upon all persons. The Administrator may delegate administrative authority under this Plan to such officers or employees of the Company or others as it may determine, except that any authority so delegated shall not extend to granting and administering awards to persons who are then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Options granted to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are intended to be granted either by the Board or by a committee composed entirely of \"non-employee directors\" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and \"outside directors\" as defined in and in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code. (b) To the greatest extent permitted by law, (i) no member or former member of the Administrator shall be liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan, and (ii) the members or former members of the Administrator shall be entitled to indemnification by the Company against and from any loss incurred by such members by reason of any such actions and determinations. 10. Delivery of Shares and Proceeds. Upon the exercise of an Option, the Administrator shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued by the Company's transfer agent and a certificate or statement of issuance to be delivered to the Optionee. The proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall be the property of the Company, and shall be delivered to it promptly by the Administrator. 11. Amendment, Suspension, or Termination of Plan.\nThe Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan or may amend it from time to time in such respects as it may deem advisable in order that the Options granted thereunder may conform to any changes in the law or in any other respect which it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company. Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate when all available Shares have been granted and no granted Option is outstanding.

Florness Holden Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Executive Officer) (Principal Financial Officer) FASTENAL COMPANY COMPENSATION FORFEITURE, RECOVERY AND TRUE-UP POLICY (Adopted October 11, 2023) Policy The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Fastenal Company (the \"Company\") has adopted this Compensation Forfeiture and Recovery Policy (this \"Policy\") pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, upon a Recoupment Event, each Covered Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company, reasonably promptly, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was received by such Covered Executive during the Lookback Period. In addition, to the extent that the Company underpaid incentive compensation due to inaccurate financial statements, Covered Executives will be reimbursed for the difference.\nAdministration This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\"). Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nDefinitions \"Accounting Restatement\" means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that (a) is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a \"Big R\" restatement) or (b) would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a \"little r\" restatement).\n\"Covered Executive\" means each of the Company's current and former Section 16 Officers.\n\"Erroneously Awarded Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the excess of the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period over the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\n\"Financial Reporting Measures\" are any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n\"Incentive-Based Compensation\" is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n\"Lookback Period\" means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company's fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nA \"Recoupment Event\" occurs when the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Required Restatement Date\" means the earlier to occur of: (x) the date the Company's Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Section 16 Officer\" is defined as an \"officer\" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act.\n\"Section 409A\" means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.\nExhibit 97 \"True-Up Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, any additional amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period, had the Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated financial statements.\nAmount Subject to Recovery The Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy includes such compensation that is received by a Covered Executive (i) on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded or granted prior to this date), (ii) after the individual began service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if the individual served as a Section 16 Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation, and (iv) while the Company is publicly traded.\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery from a Covered Executive upon a Recoupment Event is the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which amount shall be determined by the Committee.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nRecovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation Promptly following a Recoupment Event, the Committee will determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive, and the Company will provide each such Covered Executive with a written notice of such amount and a demand for repayment or return. Upon receipt of such notice, each affected Covered Executive shall promptly repay or return such Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company. If the Covered Executive repays, chooses to forfeit, or returns Erroneously Awarded Compensation within a reasonable period of time (generally not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of notification from the Company or as otherwise agreed to by the Company), the Covered Executive may elect to repay, forfeit or return the Erroneously Awarded Compensation by timely: (i) transferring funds to the Company, (ii) forfeiting any compensation that is not yet payable; or (iii) forfeiting stock options that the Covered Executive has received from the Company, whether vested or unvested, with an equivalent value to the Erroneously Award Compensation. If the Covered Executive does not timely repay, forfeit or return Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Company shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method determined by the Committee, provided that recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be made in compliance with Section 409A. The applicable Covered Executive shall also be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses (including legal fees) reasonably incurred by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\nLimited Exceptions Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be recovered in accordance with this Policy unless the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions is met: • the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, provided the Company has first made a reasonable effort to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation; or • the recovery would likely cause a U.S. tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\nReliance on any of the above exemptions will further comply with applicable listing standards, including without limitation, documenting the reason for the impracticability and providing required documentation to Nasdaq.\nNo Insurance or Indemnification The Company will not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (or related expenses incurred by the Covered Executive) pursuant to a recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy, nor will it pay or reimburse a Covered Executive for any insurance premiums on any insurance policy obtained by the Covered Executive to protect against the forfeiture or recovery of any compensation pursuant to this Policy.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Additional Incentive Compensation Due to a Covered Executive In the event of an Accounting Restatement, any True-Up Compensation due to a Covered Executive during the Look-Back Period will be paid to the Covered Executive as soon as practicable, but not later than the March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the Accounting Restatement was complete. The amount of any True-Up Compensation shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. However, in any payment of any True-Up Compensation must comply with Section 409A; in the event that a payment otherwise due under this Policy would not be in compliance with Section 409A, the amount will be forfeited. In addition, in no event whatsoever shall the Company or its officers, directors, employees or agents be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Executive by Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.\nInterpretation The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy shall be applied and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10D-1 and any applicable regulations, rules or standards adopted by SEC or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. In the event that this Policy does not meet the requirements of Rule 10D-1, the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed, this Policy shall be deemed to be amended to meet such requirements.\nAmendment; Termination The Board or the Committee may amend this Policy in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with the regulations adopted by the SEC under Rule 10D-1 and the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. The Board or the Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if that amendment or termination would cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed.\nOther Recoupment Rights Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar provision in any compensation plan agreement, and any other legal remedies available to the Company. This Policy is in addition to any other clawback or compensation recovery, recoupment or forfeiture policy that may be adopted by the Company from time to time, or any laws, rules or listing standards applicable to the Company, including without limitation, the Company's right to recoup compensation subject to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but shall supersede and replace in its entirety the Company's existing Executive Incentive Recoupment Policy adopted by the Board in 2016. To the extent that application of this Policy would provide for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that the Company recovers pursuant to another policy or provision, the amount that is recovered will be credited to the required recovery under this Policy.\nSuccessors This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Annual Meeting The annual meeting of shareholders will be at 10:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, on Thursday, April 25, 2024, at the Remlinger Muscle Car Museum located at 3560 Service Drive, Winona, Minnesota.\nHome Office Fastenal Company 2001 Theurer Boulevard Winona, Minnesota 55987-0978 Phone: 507-454-5374 I Fax: 507-453-8049 Legal Counsel Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota Form 10-K A copy of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is available without charge to shareholders upon written request to Investor Relations at the address of our home office listed on this page.

Please send updates/corrections to editor@mdm.com .\n© 2024 Modern Distribution Management. All rights reserved.\n3 2024 MDM Top Distributors Lists Latest updates at mdm.com/top_distributors Continued on next page Normalization and Tougher Comparables Welcome to Modern Distribution Management’s 2024 Top Distributors feature, now in its 15th year. Here, you’ll find our rankings of North America’s largest distributors of industrial, commercial and building supply products, based on their 2023 fiscal revenue within 20 different industry verticals. More than 200 different companies are represented across these various lists.\nIt’s MDM’s biggest research project of the year.\nBefore you dive into our rankings in the pages ahead, let's set the stage for the key factors that shaped this year’s feature and key context you should know when perusing our lists.\n2023: Strong Start, Late Fade Since our lists are based purely on 2023 fiscal rev-enues for all distributors, that year is worth examining from a high level.\nAfter riding the inflation wave in 2021 and 2022, distributors found 2023 to be less advantageous from an economic tailwind perspective. While inflation persisted throughout 2023 and has since, it leveled out throughout the year and led to far tougher year-over-year financial comparables. Meanwhile, publicly-traded distributors began to mention demand softening as early as 1Q23 quarterly earnings reports, with that ramping up as the year progressed.\nDisinflation and lower volumes resulted in the U.S. wholesale distribution sector finishing with 2023 annual revenues of $7.887 trillion, according to the MDM Forecast, which strips out agents and brokers, manufac-turers' sales branches and offices, importers and export-ers. That was down 1.8% after soaring 14.8% and 20.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSource: MDM Forecast But, it’s important to keep in mind the context that while 2023 was a downstep in overall revenue, that was compared to a record-setting and inflated previous two years. Far removed from direct impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2023 may be remembered as the first ‘normal’ year since 2019 in terms of supply chain con-ditions and escalating inflation.\nThe vast majority of the distributors on our lists posted modest annual sales gains or declines in 2023, while pockets of others outperformed their competition or were hit hard by market-specific factors. That’s continued through the first half of 2024, with firms still facing tough comps vs. the first and second quarters of a year earlier. Industry-Specific Revenue Like for the past several years, this is the most import-ant part of this introduction. Starting in 2022, MDM put a heightened emphasis on ranking companies by their sector-specific revenues rather than total revenue.\nThis also explains why you’ll see some distributors with smaller total revenues ranked higher than others within the same industry.\nTake Grainger, for example. By its total 2023 reve-nue of $16.5 billion, Grainger is North America’s largest industrial supplies distributor. But when digging into its financial reports and product sector breakouts, we find that it’s also one of North America’s top distributors of electrical, HVACR, plumbing, power transmission, fluid power and safety products. This is why Grainger ended up appearing on 10 of our 20 sector lists — the company’s revenue within each of those segments is large enough to warrant a spot. And this is why Watsco is ranked No. 1 in HVACR and Grainger is No. 5 despite Watsco’s $7.3 bil-lion in 2023 revenue being much smaller than Grainger’s $16.5 billion — Watsco’s HVACR revenue was much high-er than Grainger’s.\nThis explains why you’ll find some companies chart-ed on industry lists outside of their “core” offering. For example, Graybar is best known as an electrical products distributor, but its industrial products sales were large emough to chart at No. 20 on our Industrial Supplies list. It’s also why Ferguson appears on our lists for Industrial Supplies, Building Materials/Construction and Safety, besides its hallmarks of Plumbing, HVACR and Industrial PVF.\nBut while our rankings are based on 2023 revenue within each sector, the revenue you see displayed on our lists is overall revenue. Why? Quite simply, while many privately-owned distributors elected not to publicly share their total revenues, far fewer still elected not to publicly share their sector-specific revenues. If we displayed the sector-specific revenues of those that gave us the OK to, they’d be few and far between. The overall revenue figure gives us something to show for the majority of companies on our lists.\nThat sector-specific revenue breakout is the most painstaking part of our research process, as it involves an incredible amount of hair-splitting and triangulation to find accurate revenues. It makes this feature all the more challenging, but we do it because it results in a more accu-rate list and levels the playing field. © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

For distributors that don’t follow a January-December fiscal calendar, we’ve noted that with an asterisk and a footnote. To normalize the way we display the rankings, we include total company revenues, rather than break out individual sector revenues. Companies were asked to provide data about revenues, with information sup-plemented by quarterly fiscal reports, SEC filings and publicly available information. For companies that elect to not share revenue data, MDM estimates their relative po-sition in its sector list based on the best available industry resources and information. Note: Companies that operate primarily as master distributors are not eligible for Top Distributors inclusion. 3 New List Segments With the support from MDM’s integration into the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, we were able to add three list cagories to our feature — Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare, Food & Beverage and Lubricants & Fuels. This expansion helps our feature rep-resent even more of the wholesale distribution industry. Where's Amazon Business?\nMDM readers who have regularly seen our Top Distributors lists over the years may notice that we don’t include the industry’s biggest elephant in the room: Amazon Business. The B2B supplies marketplace ap-peared in the top six of our Industrial Supplies list since first appearing in 2018, including at No. 2 in 2022. While the platform is certainly competing directly with indus-trial, commercial and building supply distributors for market share to a tune of $35 billion in 2022 revenue, we made the decision last year to omit it from our lists due to Amazon Business’ very unique business model. It was the only company on our lists in previous years that couldn’t be described as a distributor. We do, however, include The Home Depot’s Pro segment, which directly operates via distribution sales, services and logistics. To Keep in Mind As you peruse the rankings across these different verticals, it’s important to remember that the way we put them together is not an exact science. While our editorial team made every effort to extract revenue information from the non-publicly-traded distributors listed here, many companies are understandably private with that information. We are happy to keep that revenue informa-tion strictly private and only use it internally for rankings, which an increasing number of companies opt for each year. So, when you see “N/A” listed for revenue, that likely means that revenue figure was confidentially given to MDM and to not be published.\nEven with that understanding, a smaller number of companies would rather not budge on sharing their revenue. Given the amount of large distributors that have been privately-acquired in recent years, this isn’t a sur-prise. In these cases where revenue isn’t shared, our team triangulates with respected industry experts and the best available information to estimate and rank distributors appropriately.\nAnother nugget to note is that since we used fiscal 2023 revenues for all companies, the revenues of handful of companies that don’t follow a traditional 12-month fiscal calendar represent a time difference by as much as nine months. We’ve denoted distributors that don’t follow a traditional fiscal calendar with an asterisk next to their revenue and a footnote. Questions? Comments?\nAs alluded to above, there is no perfect way to conduct these rankings. I’m sure there are MDM readers who will disagree with where and how certain companies are slotted on our list, and that’s OK, especially given our focus on sector-specific revenue. I’m very open to comments and suggestions for how we can improve this feature going forward. Don’t hesitate to reach out.\nMike Hockett Executive Editor Modern Distribution Management © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

While every MRO product may be considered an industrial product, the opposite isn’t always true. For MDM, MRO products are those needed to keep a company’s facilities and production processes running smoothly, whereas industrial products encompass MRO in addition to products involved in the manufacturing process and/or components used in the final product.\n*MSC's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 *Applied's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

It consists of companies that purchase products from manufacturers, like tools, machines, and safety equipment. These products allow a range of industries, for example, construction and factories, to perform their work. The industrial distribution market is expanding partly due to increasing industrialization, demand for rapid shipping, smart technology, and a more innovative supply chain.\n\nThe distributors make sure the product gets from the warehouse to the truck, to the facility, through a combination of warehouse space, trucks, and software methods. Examples of distributors are Motion Industries, Fastenal, and W.W. Grainger. With the increase in different industries and the increase in their respective volume, the need for a distributor is critical and will become more important. This market plays an important role in helping businesses perform their work, while keeping the U.S. economy strong and competitive.\n\n## **What Are the Market Trends in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nThe market trends in the U.S. industrial distribution market are characterized by the increasing popularity of just-in-time delivery, increasing adoption of greener practices, and data analytics in the industry.\n\n* Companies want products to be delivered quickly and only when they need them.\n* Greener practices like energy-efficient warehouses and electric trucks are being implemented more.\n* Data analytics help businesses track their inventory and improve their planning.\n* Increasing population density is leading to an increase in the demand for industrial goods, as the demand for all sorts of products and services increases.\n\n## **What Are the Restraints in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nThe growth of the U.S. industrial distribution market faces restraints such as high fuel prices, labor shortages in certain parts of the nation, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition from the large online sellers.\n\n* High fuel prices increase shipping and delivery costs for distributors.\n* Labor shortages in warehouses and logistics slow product movement.\n* Global supply chain disruptions slow product availability in the U.S.\n* Increased competition from large online sellers (example), Amazon harms smaller distributors.\n\n## **What Are the Opportunities in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nOpportunities emerging in the U.S. industrial distribution market stem from the increasing adoption of robots and automation machines in smart warehouses, increasing local activities, and a boom in small firms in the country.\n\n* Robots, barcode scanners, and Internet sensors let smart warehouses move fast and cut mistakes.\n* Bringing factories back to the U.S. raises local need for belts, motors, and other shop supplies.\n* A wave of new small firms drives fresh sales of tools, gloves, hard hats, and other safety gear.\n\n## **Recent Developments in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market:**\n\n* In February 2025, new U.S. orders for metalworking machines climbed to $389.9 million, a jump of 9.9% over January and 12.5% above February 2024; year-to-date totals now stand at $744.74 million, an 8.8% gain compared with last year.\n* In May 2025, as part of a broader leadership overhaul, SureWerx named Scott Dowell as chief executive, effective May 27, 2025, with a mandate to spur organic growth and drive a more aggressive mergers-and-acquisitions agenda.\n* In June 2025, MSC Industrial Supply earned Great Place to Work certification in the U.S. for a second straight year and secured first-time accolades in Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., with 75% of employees saying the company is a wonderful employer.\n\n## **U.S. Industrial Distribution Market Companies:**\n\n* Motion Industries (Genuine Parts Company)\n* **[W.W.

I'll extract the full texts of the key annual reports and industry summary PDFs/pages (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC, MDM Top Distributors list, Statifacts U.S. industrial distribution outlook) to pull revenue, market share, distribution/channel mix, e-commerce/digital adoption, consolidation activity, and management commentary relevant to each of Porter's Five Forces. After extraction I'll review and synthesize force-by-force evidence and strategic recommendations.

GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES At Grainger, we believe our success is measured by the positive impact we have on our customers, communities and team members. That is why our purpose, We Keep The World Working, ® is embedded in everything we do – it shapes our decisions, fuels our performance and inspires our more than 26,000 team members each day.

The expansion of our supply chain network, including the recently announced distribution centers in Oregon and Texas as well as three new bulk warehouses, will contribute an additional 3.5 million square feet to the U.S. network – a more than 35% increase from the start of the year. This expansion enhances our operational efficiency and supports our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nIn addition to our supply chain expansion, we continue to build key technology infrastructure capabilities focused on two main domains that affect the customer experience: 1. Product Information Management, knowing our products better than anyone else, and 2. Customer Information Management, knowing our customers better than anyone else. These assets store, codify and scale our data, allowing us to leverage our deep product knowledge and understanding of the customer to enhance D.G.

Along with this, we have invested in additional technology talent who partner with our MRO subject matter experts to bring Grainger’s industry know-how to life. This partnership is yielding significant benefit and helping Grainger execute on our growth engines.\nAbove all else, our success is intricately tied to the engagement of our team members to live our purpose. We received numerous workplace recognitions in 2023, which highlight the positive impact of the Grainger Edge on our team member experience and enhance our reputation as a great employer. These achievements are a testament to our unwavering commitment to creating a work environment that fosters growth, collaboration and a shared sense of purpose.\nAs we close out 2023, I want to acknowledge someone who has made a meaningful impact on the Grainger culture. This year, Ann Hailey will retire from the Grainger Board of Directors after 18 years of service. I would like to thank Ann for her leadership, service, strategic counsel and the significant contributions she has provided to Grainger. It has been a true privilege to serve alongside her, and I wish her the very best in retirement.\nSince opening our doors in 1927, Grainger has built a deep trust with our customers as we strive to be their go-to partner to fulfill their MRO needs. As we look to 2024 and beyond, our team will advance the Grainger Edge to remain focused on what matters: delivering on our growth drivers to improve the customer experience, providing exceptional service, strengthening our culture and meeting our financial goals across both models.\nThank you for your continued support, investment and trust in Grainger.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “forecast,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” or “would,” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.\nGrainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Grainger's control, which could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those that are presented.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: inflation, higher product costs or other expenses, including operational and administrative expenses; the impact of macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical trends, changes and events; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; changes in customer or product mix; increased competitive pricing pressures; changes in third-party practices regarding digital advertising; failure to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory basis with group purchasing organizations; failure to develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies, including with respect to Grainger's eCommerce platforms; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in Grainger's gross profit margin; Grainger's responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, regulations related to advertising, marketing and the Internet, consumer protection, pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes), product liability, compliance or safety, trade and export compliance, general commercial disputes, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, including new or stricter environmental laws or regulations; government contract matters; the impact of any government shutdown; disruption or breaches of information technology or data security systems involving Grainger or third parties on which Grainger depends; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including tariffs and trade issues and policies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including price and trading volume volatility or price declines of Grainger's common stock; commodity price volatility; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; outbreaks of pandemic disease or viral contagions; natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather and other catastrophes or conditions; effects of climate change; failure to execute on our efforts and programs related to environmental, social and governance matters; competition for, or failure to attract, retain, train, motivate and develop executives and key team members; loss of key members of management or key team members; loss of operational flexibility and potential for work stoppages or slowdowns if team members unionize or join a collective bargaining arrangement; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; Grainger's incurrence of indebtedness or failure to comply with restrictions and obligations under its debt agreements and instruments and other factors identified under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could impact Grainger's forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward looking-statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 4 PART I Item 1: Business W.W.

The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment primarily includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.\nEndless Assortment The Company’s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company’s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.\nOther Other businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's Cromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment. 5 Business Models Competing with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's business models: 6 Customers The Company uses a combination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million customers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger’s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost of procurement. Customers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology. Sales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock®, Grainger's inventory management solution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat. In the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.\nProducts and Services Grainger’s product offering is grouped under several broad categories, including safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools. Products are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised more than 20% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price and product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer approximately 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 13 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 22 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically adding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.\nDistribution and Sources of Supply In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering. More than 5,000 primary suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with more than 1.4 million products stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised more than 5% of Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger’s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support. Additionally, Grainger offers comprehensive inventory management through its KeepStock® program that includes vendor-managed inventory, customer-managed inventory and onsite vending machines. 7 In the Endless Assortment segment, orders are placed primarily through online channels. Zoro leverages the High-Touch Solution N.A.'s DC network and third-party drop shipments to deliver seamless service and product fulfillment to customers. MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.\nFor further information on the Company’s properties, see Part I, Item 2: Properties of this Form 10-K.\nTrademarks and Service Marks Grainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2023 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®, SPEEDAIRE®, AIR HANDLER®, TOUGH GUY®, WESTWARD®, CONDOR® and LUMAPRO®. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK® brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.\nSeasonality Grainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger’s operating results.\nCompetition Grainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support. Government Regulations Grainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. based operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2023, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.\nHuman Capital The Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger’s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board. Grainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger’s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and team member engagement.\nTeam Member Profile As of December 31, 2023, Grainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,200 were full-time and 2,900 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 85% of these team members are located in North America, 9% in Asia and 6% in Europe. 8 Workplace Practices and Policies The Company's strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.\nThe Grainger Edge principles also guide the Company’s actions supporting health and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, and team member experience, including talent acquisition and team member retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are: • Start with the Customer • Win as One Team • Embrace Curiosity • Invest in our Success • Act with Intent • Do the Right Thing • Compete with Urgency Grainger’s purpose-driven culture and principles help the Company attract, retain, motivate and develop its workforce and drive team member engagement. The Company believes an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company and measures team member engagement on an ongoing basis. The results from engagement surveys are used to inform programs and processes designed and implemented to enhance the inclusive culture Grainger aspires to achieve. Health and Safety Grainger strives to provide a safe work environment in which team members are properly prepared to perform the many tasks required to support customers. The Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to integrate EHS into Grainger’s business operations and comply with applicable regulations. To that end, the Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to confirm proper safety policies, programs and procedures. The Company is focused on promoting a culture of safety and education. Operational team members must complete routine training to fully understand the expectation of behaviors defined by the Company’s global EHS policy. Managing and reducing risks at DCs and other facilities remain a core objective and injury rates continue to be low. In 2023, the Company’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate in the U.S. was 1.3 and the Company’s Lost Time Incident Rate in the U.S. was 0.4 based upon the number of incidents per 100 team members (or per 200,000 work hours). Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Grainger believes a diverse talent pool is essential to live its principles, foster innovation, build high-performing teams and drive business results. The Company understands that future business success requires a mix of current and new skill sets, multiple experiences, and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, and strives to reflect this priority in its hiring, retention and promotion practices. The Company aspires to increasingly promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people – regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or experiences – through recruiting outreach, internal networking, business resource groups and mentoring programs.\nGrainger's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top. The Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of approximately 31% female and 23% racially and ethnically diverse directors. Grainger also maintains this strong commitment with the CEO's leadership team and throughout the organization. The CEO's U.S. based leadership team is comprised of approximately 40% women and approximately 30% racially and ethnically diverse leaders. As of December 31, 2023, within Grainger’s U.S. workforce, approximately 39% of team members were women and approximately 37% of team members were racially and ethnically diverse. Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development Grainger believes that a great customer experience starts with a great team member experience. The Company is committed to providing team members with resources designed to help them succeed. Grainger focuses on creating opportunities for team member growth, development and training, including offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout a team member’s career. This talent program is comprised of performance 9 management, career management, professional development learning opportunities and milestone leadership development programs.\nCompensation and Benefits Grainger believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate team members. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the diverse needs of team members and support their physical and mental health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Team members are given access to health plan resources which include 24-hour virtual health services, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs with access to online support communities. In addition, Grainger provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits as well as a variety of other programs.\nAvailable Information Grainger's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The risks included below are not exhaustive. As Grainger operates in a rapidly changing environment, it is not possible for management to predict all risks and the corresponding impact of each such risk or a combination of risks. The presented risks and any new risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which Grainger is exposed.\nIndustry and Market Risks Inflation could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings.\nMarket variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events, could negatively impact Grainger's ability to effectively manage its operating and administrative expenses. For example, geopolitical conflicts and related international responses have and may continue to exacerbate inflationary pressures, including increases in fuel and other energy costs. In addition, Grainger's inability to pass on increases in costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.\nDisruptions in Grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger’s logistics or supply chain network could be disrupted by the occurrence of: one or more natural or human induced disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather events or conditions; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; disruptions to transportation infrastructure and networks, including from transport providers or third-party work stoppages related to labor strikes or lockouts; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increases in costs associated with international trade. Even when Grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Grainger to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact Grainger's profitability and financial condition. Any of these circumstances could impair Grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to Grainger's reputation. Grainger’s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nFurther escalation of geopolitical tensions across the world and potential actions taken in response to them could have a broad impact on markets where Grainger does business, adversely affect its suppliers and disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of products. It is not possible to predict whether certain geopolitical events which could adversely affect Grainger's business will occur, or the broader consequences of these events if they did occur, which could include further instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy or possible sanctions, embargoes or other trade barriers.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger’s customers could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and industry trends affect Grainger’s business environment. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger’s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, interest rate fluctuations, government spending and government shutdowns, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, work stoppages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger’s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services. 13 Any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Grainger’s pricing and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in Canada, Japan, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger’s sales and results of operations.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with Grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger's products are purchased from more than 5,000 primary suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases. Disruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond Grainger’s control. These factors could include economic downturns, recessions, outbreaks of pandemic disease, natural or human induced disasters, cybersecurity attacks, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, new or increased tariffs, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems or shortages experienced by Grainger’s suppliers or others in the supply chain, transportation availability, staffing and cost, shortage of raw materials, supplier consolidation, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger’s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required, distances involved, and the range of potential consequences of various geopolitical risks. If Grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted, there could be adverse effects on inventory levels, results of operations, customer relationships and Grainger’s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing arrangements which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nFor products sold in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Grainger requires its suppliers and sub-suppliers, to comply with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics, or other similar responsible sourcing standards, as a condition of doing business with Grainger. Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics focuses on four main areas of ethical sourcing: (i) human rights and labor standards (including prohibitions on child and forced labor); (ii) environment, health and safety; (iii) sanctions, trade, bribery and corruption; and (iv) privacy and information security. The Code also addresses how to report potential Code violations and related concerns. Grainger does not control its suppliers and their sub-suppliers, and neither Grainger nor its suppliers or other partners may be able to uncover all instances of noncompliance with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics and ethical and lawful business practices. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, product recalls, or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business. Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture certain products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. The recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. The level of demand for Grainger's products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities, including fuel. Fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services, including as a result of a pandemic, could affect transportation costs. Grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, 14 the Financial Statements of Grainger’s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger’s international subsidiaries, primarily the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi and euro, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency exchange rate is driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors and fiscal decisions of various governments and central banks, all over which Grainger has no control. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect Grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition and other risks could impact demand for Grainger’s products and services.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger’s high-touch operations, eCommerce platforms and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses.\nTo remain competitive, Grainger must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. Downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause Grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. Grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. These pressures could have a material effect on Grainger’s sales and profitability. To manage these potential pressures, Grainger continuously considers the adoption of new operating initiatives, including new marketing programs, productivity improvements, inventory management and loss prevention initiatives, and other similar strategies. If Grainger is unable to sustain or grow sales, reduce costs, and prevent loss and fraud, among other actions, Grainger's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements, innovations and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. Developing, upgrading, managing or implementing new technologies, business applications, strategies and innovations may require significant investment of resources by Grainger, may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, may increase Grainger's vulnerability to cyber breaches, attacks or intrusions, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.\nThe growth of Grainger’s eCommerce platforms exposes Grainger to additional risks which could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The successful execution of Grainger’s eCommerce growth strategy depends on a number of factors, including Grainger’s investment in its eCommerce platforms, consumer preferences and purchasing trends, and the ability to deliver a seamless procurement experience across digital and also physical retail channels. As its eCommerce platforms have grown in recent years, Grainger has increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing technology information systems, software development and other capabilities to provide simplified customer interactions and to provide high-quality, user-friendly service to its customers and streamline customer interactions. Grainger has also made significant investments in digital advertising and customer acquisition and retention efforts for its eCommerce channels, including through paid and non-paid advertising such as display advertising, search engine optimization, email and mobile “push” notifications. If Grainger’s customer-facing technology systems are perceived as more difficult or less compelling for customers to use than those of Grainger’s competitors, or if digital marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these investments, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, Grainger faces many risks and uncertainties beyond the Company's control, including theft, credit card fraud, and other fraudulent behavior. 15 Grainger has also increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and large language model technologies. While the use of these technologies can present significant benefits to Grainger, it also creates risks and challenges. Further, if these investments in Grainger’s eCommerce platforms are less successful at attracting and retaining customers than similar investments by our competitors, or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these technological investments generally, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the successful operation of Grainger’s eCommerce channels depends in part upon third parties and factors over which Grainger has limited or no control. For example, Grainger relies in part on Internet search engines to drive traffic to its websites, and the reach of Grainger’s eCommerce channels is impacted by how and where its websites rank in both paid and unpaid search results. Potential changes to search engine ranking rules could cause Grainger’s websites to place lower in search results and cause Grainger to incur increased advertising costs in order to increase its visibility. Further, ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy, online tracking technologies such as cookies, digital advertising and other eCommerce matters could require Grainger to modify its eCommerce strategy, incur significant additional costs to comply with such changes or otherwise adversely affect Grainger’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Grainger also relies on email and other messaging services to promote its websites and product offerings, and changes in Grainger’s current or prospective customers’ use of email or other messaging services or actions by third parties to block, restrict or charge for the delivery of such messages could adversely affect sales through Grainger’s eCommerce channels and Grainger’s results of operations.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger’s revenue or gross margin, or affect Grainger’s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in its customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions and divestitures, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of eCommerce by Grainger and its competitors.\nIn addition, Grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. If Grainger is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with GPOs, Grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs its customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into Grainger’s existing assortment could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger’s competitive position. The inclusion of Grainger-branded products in the product assortment could subject Grainger to increased claims and litigation activity. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights, including against the manufacturer of such products, may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures.\nGrainger’s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading prices and volumes of Grainger’s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger’s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, Grainger’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchases or dividends, economic decline, political unrest or geopolitical conflict, outbreak of pandemic disease, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A. These factors, many of which are outside of Grainger’s control, could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or Grainger’s stock price to decline. Volatility in the price of Grainger's securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nGrainger has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). MonotaRO's disclosure and reporting obligations under TSE listing requirements and Japanese securities laws, including the timing of such obligations, may vary from Grainger's obligations under New York Stock Exchange 16 listing requirements and U.S. securities laws. MonotaRO's listed securities may be subject to the same volatility, price and securities litigation risks to which Grainger's common stock is subject.\nOperational Risks Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.\nThe functioning of Grainger’s information systems is critical to the operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures to effectively manage its information systems. However, Grainger may not be able to maintain or update its information systems to capture and use data in ways that result in operational efficiency, including as a result of ineffective software, difficulties obtaining the right talent and ability to manage the increasing volume of data available to, and managed by Grainger. Furthermore, although Grainger’s information systems are protected with backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third-party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. In addition, Grainger relies on the information technology (IT) systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.\nThe implementation of new systems and upgrades to existing systems could impact Grainger's operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management's time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, Grainger's systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other IT disruption could have an adverse effect on its business.\nIf Grainger’s systems or those of third parties on which Grainger depends are damaged, breached, cease to function properly or are otherwise disrupted, Grainger may require a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interim interruptions in its business operations. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, Grainger’s ability to operate its eCommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store team member or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations. Grainger has experienced these incidents in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage Grainger’s reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nThrough Grainger’s sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on Grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with Grainger. Moreover, Grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and team member, and other sensitive matters.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in Grainger's information systems. Loss of customer, supplier, and team member information, intellectual property or other business information, or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could, for example, disrupt operations, damage Grainger’s reputation and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Grainger, including its financial condition and results of operations. If successful, cyber-attacks may expose Grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations. The transition in recent years to remote and “hybrid” working arrangements may increase Grainger’s vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage Grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose Grainger to claims or other actions from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others. 17 Grainger's IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers, vendors and other third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information. Moreover, Grainger shares information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business. Although Grainger performs risk assessments on third parties where appropriate to learn about their security program, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. Moreover, Grainger may face threats to its information systems, for example, unauthorized access, business email compromise, viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, and organized cyber-attacks. If successful, those attempting to penetrate Grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, team member or business information, or cause systems disruption. While many of Grainger's agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions, Grainger may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur.\nIn addition, a Grainger team member, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures or otherwise access Grainger’s information. Grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems and a breach of Grainger's systems could be used as an attempt to gain illicit access to customer systems and information. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger's business, operations or financial condition. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until they are launched against a target. Grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventative measures. Any breach of Grainger’s security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third-party service providers could cause Grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, team members and other parties whose information is compromised. Such a breach could also cause Grainger to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. Although Grainger maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks, depending on the nature, location and extent of any event, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nGrainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents and in each instance Grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. None of these incidents have been deemed to be material to Grainger and Grainger has neither incurred any material net expenses nor been materially penalized or subject to any material settlement amounts with respect to such incidents in the last three years. However, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to Grainger’s operations and financial condition.\nFor further information regarding Grainger's cybersecurity risk management strategy and the Board's oversight role, see Part I, Item 1C: Cybersecurity of this Form 10-K.\nGrainger’s eCommerce channels are subject to risks related to online payment methods and other online transactions, including through purchasing platforms.\nGrainger accepts a variety of payment methods via its eCommerce channels, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and other payment methods and other online transactions, including through its eProcurement technologies which communicate directly with Grainger.com and Grainger's other eCommerce channels. Although Grainger generally relies on third parties to facilitate eCommerce payments and payment processing services, Grainger may become subject to additional compliance requirements and regulations regarding these transactions, and may also suffer losses from online fraudulent transactions on its eCommerce channels. In addition, Grainger must pay certain transaction fees relating to these transactions, which may increase over time and could have an impact on product margin, profitability and operating costs. Grainger’s eCommerce channels may become subject to further rules and regulations, and changes in these rules and regulations, or their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect results of operations.\nGrainger’s inability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. 18 Grainger’s business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of Grainger’s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect Grainger’s rights. In addition, Grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject Grainger to liability, require Grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause Grainger to modify its operations.\nIn order to compete, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop and retain key team members, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nIn order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop, and retain executives and other key team members, including those in managerial, technical, sales, supply chain, technology development and information technology positions. Grainger competes to hire team members at increasingly competitive wage rates and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Qualified individuals needed to fill open positions may be in short supply in some areas. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect Grainger's labor costs. Competition for qualified team members could require Grainger to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of team members. Additionally collective bargaining or unionization of team members could decrease Grainger's operational flexibility and lead to work stoppages or slowdowns. The performance of Grainger’s stock price could impact Grainger’s use of equity-based compensation to attract and retain executives and other key team members. The success of Grainger's team member hiring and retention also depends on Grainger's ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its team members to thrive.\nGenerally, higher wages and benefit costs, competition for diverse talent, and the risk of an increase in team member turnover, could adversely affect Grainger's results of operations. Further, failure to successfully hire executives and key team members or adequately plan for the succession, transition, and assimilation of executive leaders and team members in key roles, or to plan for the loss of executives and key team members, could adversely affect Grainger's business results and financial condition. Grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger’s reputation.\nOne of the reasons customers choose to do business with Grainger and team members choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. Grainger devotes time and resources to environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation, including programs driving environmental sustainability, ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity, equity and inclusion, and gender equality. These efforts and programs could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement, and Grainger’s actual or perceived failure to execute its ESG programs as planned could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, business and financial performance. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger’s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business.\nRegulatory, Legal and Tax Risks Grainger is subject to a complex array of laws, regulations and standards globally. Failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation and other regulatory proceedings could adversely affect Grainger's financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nGrainger’s business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., and its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan.\nThe wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each jurisdiction where Grainger operates, include, but are not limited to, advertising, marketing and Internet regulations (including the use of proprietary or third-party “cookies” in connection with Grainger’s eCommerce platforms), anti-bribery and corruption laws, competition and antitrust regulations, data protection (including, because Grainger accepts credit cards, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act and Privacy Rights Act, 19 in Japan, the Act on Protection of Personal Information, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, currency exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export compliance (including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and anti-money laundering regulations), intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to U.S. taxes on international subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. Moreover, Grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties, remediation costs and/or significant legal fees as well as potential damage to Grainger’s reputation. Changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. Furthermore, while Grainger has implemented policies and procedures and provides training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that team members, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or Grainger’s policies. Any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.\nGrainger’s contracts with federal, state and local government entities are subject to various and changing regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. In addition, Grainger’s government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. From time to time, Grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. Violations of these terms, rules, and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. Any such penalties could result in damage to Grainger’s reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn conducting its business, Grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by Grainger’s products or services.\nGrainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. Grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, environmental or property damage or other commercial disputes, and the types of matters discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The defense of any proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management’s time and attention, and Grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that Grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures. Grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. Grainger's reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. Tax changes could affect Grainger’s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nGrainger’s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of Grainger’s relative overall profitability and the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of Grainger's tax exposures. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two guidelines address the increasing digitization of the global economy, re-allocating taxing rights among countries. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected during 2024. Grainger continues to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods. Based on information to date, Grainger does not expect either the Pillar One or Two proposals to materially impact the Company’s global income tax liability or effective tax rate. 20 Grainger may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations designed to address climate change. The potential impacts of climate change on Grainger’s suppliers, product offerings, operations, facilities and customers are accelerating and uncertain. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change have resulted in, and may continue to result in, more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that have resulted in, and could continue to result in, more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. New laws, regulations and enforcement could strain Grainger’s suppliers and result in increased compliance-related costs, which could result in higher product costs that are passed to Grainger. New or changing environmental laws and regulations could also increase Grainger’s operating costs, including through higher utility and transportation costs, and Grainger is unable to predict the potential impact such laws and regulations could have on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy and product demand, impact Grainger's transportation costs and supply chain network, and could increase Grainger’s operating costs. Natural disasters as a result of climate change at locations where Grainger, its suppliers or customers operate could cause disruptions to Grainger’s operations, which could adversely affect sales and could negatively impact Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If environmental laws, regulations, and other stakeholder requirements impose significant operational restrictions or compliance requirements upon Grainger or its suppliers, products, or customers, or Grainger's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, Grainger's business, capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Changes in Grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.\nGrainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial strength and factors outside of Grainger’s control, such as conditions affecting Grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of Grainger’s securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the Company’s existing credit facilities or on future financings.\nGrainger has incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent Grainger from fulfilling its obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. The Company’s indebtedness could, among other things, limit Grainger’s ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the Company’s financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe agreements governing Grainger’s debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. Grainger’s failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow Grainger’s creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.\nIn addition, Grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes. Grainger’s ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on, among other things, the Company’s financial condition, prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments None.\nItem 1C: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Grainger has a cybersecurity team that works to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats. The team has implemented processes designed to assess, identify and manage material risks and vulnerabilities to the Company’s security posture, including prioritizing and remediating such risks. The team also works to assess and manage cybersecurity risks by: (i) reviewing cyber risks with senior management, including the Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO); (ii) incorporating cybersecurity in its enterprise risk processes; (iii) establishing regular reviews of cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts, including with the Audit Committee and the Board; and (iv) using third parties as needed for reviews and testing. Grainger regularly identifies its enterprise risks. Grainger’s cybersecurity team reviews and updates its information security strategy and plans to align cybersecurity prioritization with the identified top enterprise risks. Grainger has developed a cybersecurity risk intake process to facilitate the identification of cybersecurity risks, including those related to third-party vendors. Identified risks are tracked by management, and incorporated into mitigation plans. The management team engaged in the cybersecurity risk management process, including the CTO, has risk management backgrounds, certifications, and/or cyber experience in prior professional roles and at Grainger. The team maintains expertise on cyber risk management through third-party consultants, external trainings, and affiliations with relevant organizations. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access of systems on which certain supplier, customer, and team member information was stored, which have been deemed immaterial to our business and operations individually and in the aggregate. Grainger, or third-party service providers engaged by Grainger, may be subject to other unauthorized access of information systems in the future. There can be no assurance that any future unauthorized access to or breach of these information systems will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and processes, including with respect to cybersecurity. Both the Board and the Audit Committee regularly review the Company’s risk assessment and management processes and policies and receive regular updates from the Company’s management team members who are responsible for the effectiveness of the Company’s ERM program. As part of its ERM oversight, the Board oversees and regularly reviews the Company’s programs and processes for cybersecurity risks, including the Company’s framework for preventing, detecting, and addressing cybersecurity incidents and identifying emerging risks both broadly and within related industries. The Company’s CTO routinely provides cybersecurity updates to the Audit Committee and information to the Board. The CTO leads an information security team that works to facilitate the protection of the Company’s information and computing assets. 22 Item 2: Properties As of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled approximately 30.4 million square feet. Grainger owns and leases facilities primarily in the U.S., Japan, Canada(5), Mexico(6), Puerto Rico(7) and the U.K.(8) The Company owns its corporate headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and leases other general offices in the Chicago Metropolitan area that consists of approximately one million square feet.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in MD&A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nPercentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.\nOverview W.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.\nStrategic Priorities The Company’s continued strategic aspiration for 2024 is to relentlessly expand Grainger’s leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To achieve this, each Grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and MRO market outgrowth. In the High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) segment, businesses are focused on three areas: advantaged MRO solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. In the Endless Assortment segment, businesses are focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. Additionally, all Grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.\nRecent Events Inflationary Cost Environment and Macroeconomic Pressures The global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. These disruptions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, inflation and a potential recession on the Company’s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. As a result of continued inflation, the Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs while also remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company’s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company’s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFor further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 26 Results of Operations In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" The following table is included as an aid to understanding the changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions of dollars). For the Years Ended December 31, % of Net Sales 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 Net sales(1) $ 16,478 $ 15,228 8.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 9,982 9,379 6.4 60.6 61.6 Gross profit 6,496 5,849 11.1 39.4 38.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,931 3,634 8.2 23.8 23.9 Operating earnings 2,565 2,215 15.8 15.6 14.5 Other expense – net 65 69 (5.5) 0.4 0.4 Income tax provision 597 533 12.0 3.6 3.5 Net earnings 1,903 1,613 18.0 11.6 10.6 Less noncontrolling interest 74 66 12.5 0.5 0.4 Net earnings attributable to W.W.

Daily, organic constant currency net sales excludes the results of E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture and excludes the impact on net sales due to year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. There were 254 and 255 sales days in the full year 2023 and 2022, respectively. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" Net sales of $16,478 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,250 million, or 8%, and on a daily, organic constant currency basis, net sales increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. Both High-Touch Solutions N.A. and the Endless Assortment segments contributed to sales growth in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's net sales, see the Segment Analysis section below.\nGross profit of $6,496 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $647 million, or 11%, and gross profit margin of 39.4% increased 100 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Both segments contributed to margin expansion in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's gross profit, see the Segment Analysis section below. 27 Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $3,931 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $297 million, or 8%. Adjusted SG&A of $3,905 million increased $250 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2022 driven by higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points in 2023. Operating earnings of $2,565 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $350 million, or 16%. Adjusted operating earnings of $2,591 million increased $397 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by increased SG&A consistent with sales growth in 2023. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in 2023. Income tax expense of $597 million and $533 million represents effective tax rates of 23.9% and 24.8% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was positively impacted by increased benefits related to stock compensation in 2023. Diluted earnings per share was $36.23 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $36.67 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 24% compared to $29.66 for the same period in 2022. 28 Non-GAAP Measures Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. Organic net sales results exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and results of certain divested businesses in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture. Adjusted results including adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Business Divestitures In the fourth quarter of 2023, Grainger divested E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. (E&R) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in SG&A. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Grainger divested Cromwell's wholly owned software business in the U.K. and recorded a one-time pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $21 million in SG&A. The Company does not expect these business exits to have a material effect on its future results of operations. 29 The following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, High-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment Total Company(1) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 13,267 8.9 % $ 2,916 4.7 % $ 16,478 8.2 % Daily impact(3) 0.2 0.4 — 0.4 0.3 0.4 Daily net sales 52.4 9.3 11.5 5.1 65.2 8.6 Foreign currency exchange(4) — — 0.6 5.3 0.6 0.9 Business divestiture(5) — 0.1 — — — — Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 52.4 9.4 % $ 12.1 10.4 % $ 65.8 9.5 % 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 12,182 19.6 % $ 2,787 8.2 % $ 15,228 16.9 % Daily impact(3) (0.2) (0.5) — (0.5) (0.2) (0.4) Daily net sales 47.6 19.1 10.9 7.7 59.5 16.5 Foreign currency exchange(4) 0.1 0.2 1.3 12.4 1.5 2.8 Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 47.7 19.3 % $ 12.2 20.1 % 61.0 19.3 % (1) Total Company includes Other.

Segment Analysis In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see above \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" For further segment information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 13,267 $ 12,182 8.9 % Gross profit 5,546 4,951 12.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,212 2,968 8.2 Operating earnings $ 2,334 $ 1,983 17.7 % Net sales of $13,267 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,085 million, or 9% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to volume of 5% and price, which includes customer mix, of 4%. Gross profit of $5,546 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $595 million, or 12%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% increased 120 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies in 2023. 32 SG&A of $3,212 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $244 million, or 8%, and adjusted SG&A of $3,186 million increased $218 million, or 7% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022.\nOperating earnings of $2,334 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $351 million, or 18%, and adjusted operating earnings of $2,360 million increased $377 million, or 19% compared to the same period in 2022. Endless Assortment The following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 2,916 $ 2,787 4.7 % Gross profit 864 817 5.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 631 594 6.2 Operating earnings $ 233 $ 223 4.3 % Net sales of $2,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $129 million, or 5%, and on a daily constant currency basis, increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to sales growth of 10%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise growth at MonotaRO, partially offset by declining sales at Zoro and non-core, consumer-like customers for the segment. Sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.\nGross profit of $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $47 million, or 6%, and gross profit margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight efficiencies at MonotaRO partially offset by unfavorable product mix at Zoro in 2023.\nSG&A of $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll and benefit expenses to support the continued growth of the segment in 2023. SG&A leverage decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Operating earnings of $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.\nSources of Liquidity Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and $325 million, respectively. The increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and favorable year-over-year working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher volume of share repurchases. The Company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of December 31, 2023. 33 Cash Flows The following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,031 $ 1,333 Investing activities (422) (263) Financing activities (1,278) (972) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4 (14) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 335 $ 84 Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,031 million and $1,333 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period was due to higher earnings and favorable changes in year-over-year working capital largely driven by sales growth, inventory management and timing of cash receipts and payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $422 million and $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period primarily reflects increased U.S. supply chain investments including capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives, as well as technology enhancements across the Company. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,278 million and $972 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher treasury stock repurchases.\nDebt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. For further information regarding the Company's debt instruments and available financing sources, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 40.1% and 45.9%, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Ratings Grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade. The following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings as of December 31, 2023: Corporate Senior Unsecured Short-term Moody's A2 A2 P1 S&P A+ A+ A1 Uses of Liquidity Internally generated cash flows are the primary source of Grainger's working capital and growth initiatives, including 34 capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWorking Capital Working capital as of December 31, 2023 was $3,078 million, an increase of $214 million compared to $2,864 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to sustained sales growth and inventory management driven by supply chain efficiencies compared to the prior year period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. Capital Expenditures In fiscal 2023, the Company's capital expenditures were $445 million and $256 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital project spending for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $400 and $500 million. This includes continued supply chain capacity expansion and technology enhancements across the Company. With Grainger's strategic plan to expand its distribution network, the Company completed land purchases in Oregon and Texas in the second and fourth quarters of 2023 for construction of approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 square foot distribution centers (DC), respectively.\nShare Repurchases For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for $850 million and $603 million, respectively. Share repurchases are executed at prices the Company determines appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and the Company's financial performance and may be affected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Share repurchases for 2024 are expected to be in the range of $900 and $1,100 million.\nDividends For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger declared and paid $392 million and $370 million, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company's common stock. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations The Company's material cash requirements include the following commitments and other contractual obligations. Debt As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding debt obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,337 million, with $34 million payable within 12 months. Total future interest payments associated with the Company's outstanding debt obligations was $1,729 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations Grainger had purchase obligations of approximately $1,453 million as of December 31, 2023, which includes approximately $1,175 million payable within 12 months. Grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory, uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment and other goods and services. Purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs and are primarily noncancelable.\nLeases The Company has lease arrangements for certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space). As of December 31, 2023, the Company had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $492 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months. 35 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Grainger’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The majority of the Company’s inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. The Company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. If business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. For further information on the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nContingencies and Legal Matters The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. For further information on the Company's contingencies and legal matters, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 36 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Grainger's primary market risk exposures is as follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Grainger’s financial results, including the value of assets and liabilities, are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units outside the U.S., as stated in their local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 18% of the Company's net sales were denominated in a currency other than the Company's functional U.S. dollar currency. Consequently, the Company is exposed to the impact of exchange rate volatility primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nInterest Rate Risks Grainger is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt. In February 2020, Grainger entered into certain derivative instrument agreements to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt to manage this risk. The annualized effect of a hypothetical 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on Grainger’s variable-rate debt obligations would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nFor debt and derivative instrument information, see Note 5 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risks Grainger’s transportation costs are exposed to fluctuations in the price of fuel and some sourced products contain commodity-priced materials. The Company regularly monitors commodity trends and, as a broad line supplier, mitigates any material exposure to commodity price risk by having alternative sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of supplier concentration, passing commodity-related inflation to customers or suppliers and continuing to scale its distribution networks, including its transportation infrastructure. 37 Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 38 Valuation of Goodwill for the Canadian Reporting Unit Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the goodwill balance of the Canada business reporting unit was $124 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment analysis is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as projections of future operating expenditures, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our audit procedures included, among others obtaining an understanding, evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumption described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Canada business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and involving our valuation specialists to assist in testing the significant assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix, and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 39 W.W.

Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, the endless assortment business in Japan, with the residual representing the noncontrolling interest. The Company reports MonotaRO on a one-month calendar lag allowing for the timely preparation of financial statements. This one-month reporting lag is with the exception of significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform with the current year presentation. The Company reclassified amounts to separately disclose Non-cash lease expense as an adjustment to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities and Operating lease liabilities as a change in operating assets and liabilities. Previously, the net activity for these amounts were included in Depreciation and amortization. The change had no effect on previously reported results including net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nForeign Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the Company's reporting currency for all periods presented. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Translation gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive earnings (losses). Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a sales arrangement with a customer exists (e.g., contract, purchase orders, others), the transaction price is fixed or determinable and the Company has satisfied its performance obligation per the sales arrangement. The majority of Company revenue originates from contracts with a single performance obligation to deliver products, whereby performance obligations are satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer per the arranged shipping terms. Some Company contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations and are satisfied when the services are rendered. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for approximately 1% of the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company’s revenue is measured at the determinable transaction price, net of any variable considerations granted to customers and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Variable considerations include rights to return products and sales incentives, which primarily consist of volume rebates. These variable considerations are estimated throughout the year based on various factors, including contract terms, historical experience and performance levels. Total accrued sales returns were approximately $52 million and $38 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as a reduction of Accounts receivable – net. Total accrued sales incentives were approximately $114 million and $102 45 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as part of Accrued expenses.\nThe Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events other than the passage of time. The Company also records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligation. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations, contract assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes the purchase cost of goods sold net of vendor considerations, in-bound shipping costs, outbound shipping and handling costs and service costs. The Company receives vendor considerations, such as rebates to promote their products, which are generally recorded as a reduction to COGS. Rebates earned from vendors that are based on product purchases are capitalized into inventory and rebates earned based on products sold are credited directly to COGS. Total accrued vendor rebates were $155 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported in Trade accounts payable. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) Company SG&A is primarily comprised of payroll and benefits, advertising, depreciation and amortization, lease, indirect purchasing, supply chain and branch operations, technology, and selling expenses, as well as other types of general and administrative costs.\nAdvertising Advertising costs, which include online marketing, are generally expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented or when incurred. Total advertising expense was $638 million, $519 million and $402 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Incentive Plans The Company measures all share-based payments using fair-value-based methods and records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Also, the Company evaluates deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required using a “more likely than not” standard. This assessment considers the nature, frequency and amount of book and taxable income and losses, the duration of statutory carryback and forward periods, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, among other matters.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties to its tax uncertainties in the provision for income taxes.\nOther Comprehensive Earnings (Losses) The Company's Other comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrecognized gains (losses) on postretirement and other employment-related benefit plans. Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) (AOCE) are presented separately as part of shareholders' equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 46 Concentration of Credit Risk The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. Also, the Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries across North America, Japan and U.K. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company’s accounts receivable arises primarily from sales on credit to customers and are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company establishes allowances for credit losses on customer accounts that are potentially uncollectible. These allowances are determined based on several factors, including the age of the receivables, historical collection trends and economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. The allowance is determined by using the loss-rate method, which requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers.\nInventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale. The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or market, to account for approximately 77% of total inventory and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, for the remaining inventory. The Company regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and records excess and obsolete provisions representing the difference between excess and obsolete inventories and market value. Estimated market value considers various variables, including product demand, aging and shelf life, market conditions, and liquidation or disposition history and values. If FIFO had been used for all of the Company’s inventories, they would have been $770 million and $693 million higher than reported as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Concurrently, net earnings would have increased by $58 million, $139 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty, Buildings and Equipment Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the asset classes using the straight-line method. Useful lives for buildings, structures and improvements range from 10 to 50 years and furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment from three to 15 years. Amounts expended for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Long-Lived Assets The carrying value of long-lived assets, primarily property, buildings and equipment and amortizable intangibles, is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, are less than their carrying value. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nLeases The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding current and long-term lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. 47 ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement or possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of lease payments is determined using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate, the ROU asset and the lease liability are re-evaluated upon a lease modification.\nCertain lease agreements include variable lease payments that primarily include payments for non-lease components including pass-through operating expenses such as certain maintenance costs and utilities, and payments for non-components such as real estate taxes and insurance. Lease agreements with fixed lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. Certain of the Company’s lease arrangements contain renewal provisions from one to 30 years, exercisable at the Company's option. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company’s operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in SG&A.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets In a business acquisition, the Company recognizes goodwill as the excess purchase price of an acquired reporting unit over the net amount assigned to assets acquired including intangible assets and liabilities assumed. Acquired intangibles include both assets with indefinite lives and assets that are subject to amortization, which are amortized straight-line over their estimated useful lives. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The Company performs qualitative assessments of significant events and circumstances, such as reporting units' historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, strategic initiatives and overall economic factors to determine the existence of impairment indicators and assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value that would necessitate a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative test, Grainger compares the carrying value of the reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset with its fair value. Any excess of the carrying value over fair value is recorded as an impairment charge, presented as part of SG&A.\nThe fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. Estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value.\nThe Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The key assumptions when valuing a trade name are the revenue base, the royalty rate and the discount rate.\nAdditionally, the Company capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development of internal-use software, which are presented as intangible assets. Amortization of capitalized software is on a straight-line basis over three or five years.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Company uses statistical methods and qualitative comparisons of critical terms. The extent to which a derivative has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item is assessed and 48 documented periodically. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company classifies them as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.\nContingencies The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is both probable and estimable. If the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded, but the loss contingency and the reasons to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed. If a loss is reasonably possible, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. For further discussion on the Company's contingencies, see Note 14. New Accounting Standards Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This update requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with the option to early adopt prior to the effective date and requires application on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the impact of the requirements on the related segment reporting disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This update requires public entities to disclose consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with the option to early adopt prior to the effective date and should be applied on prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the requirements on the related income tax disclosures. 49 NOTE 2 - REVENUE The Company's revenue is primarily comprised of MRO product sales and related activities, such as freight and services.\nGrainger serves a large number of customers in diverse industries, which are subject to different economic and market-specific factors. The Company's presentation of revenue by segment and industry most reasonably depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic and market-specific factors. In addition, the segments have unique underlying risks associated with customer purchasing behaviors. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, more than two-thirds of revenue is derived from customer contracts whereas in the Endless Assortment segment, a majority of revenue is derived from non-contractual purchases.\nThe following table presents the Company's percentage of revenue by reportable segment and by major customer industry: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022(1) 2021(1) High-Touch Solutions N.A.

Based on the results of that testing, the Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts at each respective period.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A. – Canada Business As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Canada business reporting unit had goodwill of $124 million and $121 million, respectively. As part of our annual impairment testing, the Company compared the current results to forecasted expectations of the most recent quantitative analysis, along with analyzing macroeconomic conditions, current industry trends and transactions, and other market data of industry peers. The Company also performed various sensitivities over key assumptions, including projections of future operating expenditures used in the analysis. The Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators for its Canada business, and concluded it was more likely than not its fair value exceeded its carrying value. The Company's balances and changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill by segment are as follows (in millions of dollars): High-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment Total Balance at January 1, 2022 $ 321 $ 63 $ 384 Translation (8) (5) (13) Balance at December 31, 2022 313 58 371 Translation 2 (3) (1) Balance at December 31, 2023 $ 315 $ 55 $ 370 Grainger's cumulative goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2023, was $137 million.

Grainger may obtain loans in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding $1.25 billion, which may be increased up to $1.875 billion at the request of the Company, subject to obtaining additional commitments and other customary conditions. The primary purpose of the 2023 Credit Facility is to support the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. The 2023 Credit Facility replaced the Company's former $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of February 2020 (2020 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to mature in February 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility was terminated in October 2023.\nThere were no borrowings outstanding under the Company's 2023 Credit Facility and terminated 2020 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Senior Notes In the years 2015-2020, Grainger issued $2.3 billion in unsecured long-term debt (senior notes) primarily to provide flexibility in funding general working capital needs, share repurchases and long-term cash requirements. The senior notes require no principal payments until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. The Company incurred debt issuance costs related to the senior notes representing underwriting fees and other expenses. These costs were recorded as a contra-liability in Long-term debt and are being amortized over the term of the senior notes using the straight-line method to Interest expense – net. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unamortized costs were $19 million and $21 million, respectively.\nGrainger uses interest rate swaps to manage the risks associated with the 1.85% senior notes. These swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. The resulting carrying value adjustments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in Other in the table above. For further discussion on the Company's hedge accounting policies and derivative instruments, see Note 11.\nTerm Loan In August 2020, MonotaRO entered into a ¥9 billion term loan agreement to fund technology investments and the expansion of its distribution center (DC) network. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the term loan, including current maturities due within one year, was $32 million and $69 million, respectively. The term loan matures in 2024, payable over two equal remaining semi-annual principal installments in 2024 and bears an average interest rate of 0.05%. 53 Fair Value The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior notes was based on available external pricing data and current market rates for similar debt instruments, among other factors, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company's debt instruments include affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for companies with similar credit ratings and do not contain any financial performance covenants. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries utilize various financing sources for working capital purposes and other operating needs. These financing sources in aggregate were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe scheduled aggregate principal payments required on the Company's indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within the debt arrangements, for the succeeding five years, excluding debt issuance costs and the impact of derivatives, are due as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Payment Amount 2024 $ 34 2025 503 2026 — 2027 — 2028 — Thereafter 1,800 Total $ 2,337 NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company provides various retirement benefits to eligible team members, including contributions to defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and other benefits. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on team member location. Various foreign benefit plans cover team members in accordance with local legal requirements.\nDefined Contribution Plans A majority of the Company's U.S. team members are covered by a retirement savings plan, which provides for an automatic contribution equal to 6% of the eligible team member's total eligible compensation. The total retirement savings plan expense was $85 million, $87 million, and $78 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company sponsors additional defined contribution plans available to certain U.S. and foreign team members for which contributions are made by the Company and participating team members. The expense associated with these defined contribution plans totaled $21 million, $11 million and $16 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPostretirement Healthcare Benefits Plans The Company has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides coverage for certain U.S. team members. Covered team members become eligible for participation when they qualify for retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the Company. 54 The net periodic benefits costs were valued with a measurement date of January 1 for each year and consisted of the following components (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 SG&A Service cost $ 2 $ 4 $ 5 Other (income) expense Interest cost 5 4 3 Expected return on assets (6) (8) (8) Amortization of prior service credit (10) (10) (9) Amortization of unrecognized gains (7) (9) (8) Net periodic benefits $ (16) $ (19) $ (17) Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit asset, which is calculated as of December 31 measurement date, the fair value of plan assets available for benefits and the funded status of the benefit asset follow (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 112 $ 153 Service cost 2 4 Interest cost 5 4 Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Actuarial loss (gains) 2 (40) Benefits paid (10) (12) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 114 $ 112 Plan assets available for benefits at beginning of year $ 162 $ 207 Actual returns on plan assets 18 (36) Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Benefits paid (10) (12) Plan assets available for benefits at end of year 173 162 Noncurrent postretirement benefit asset $ 59 $ 50 The amounts recognized in AOCE consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Prior service credit $ 23 $ 33 Unrecognized gains 79 77 Deferred tax liability (25) (28) Net accumulated gains $ 77 $ 82 The Company has elected to amortize the amount of net unrecognized gains over a period equal to the average remaining service period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits of approximately 10 years for 2023.\nThe postretirement benefit obligation is determined by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models. These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, mortality and cost-sharing between the Company and the retirees. The actuarial loss recognized during the plan year is primarily related to the change in discount rate assumption. 55 The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic benefit costs as of January 1: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.92 % 2.57 % 2.17 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.50 % 6.50 % 5.81 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2030 2026 The following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.73 % 4.92 % 2.57 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.20 % 7.50 % 6.50 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2033 2030 The Company's investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and seeks to reach a balance allocation between Fixed Income securities and Equities of approximately 65% and 35%, respectively. Current allocations may differ from targeted allocations based on investment results and other timing factors. The plan's assets are stated at fair value, which represents the net asset value of shares held by the plan in the registered investment companies at the quoted market prices (Level 1 input) or at significant other observable inputs (Level 2 input). The plan assets available for benefits consisted of the following as of December 31 (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Asset class: Level 1 inputs: Mutual funds: Funds – municipal/provincial bonds $ — $ 8 Funds – corporate bonds fund 10 3 Level 2 inputs: Fixed income: Corporate bonds 56 57 Government/municipal bonds 9 12 Equity funds 88 73 Plan assets 163 153 Trust assets 10 9 Plan assets available for benefits $ 173 $ 162 56 The Company forecasts the following benefit payments related to postretirement (which include a projection for expected future team member service) for the next ten years (in millions of dollars): Year Estimated Gross Benefit Payments 2024 $ 9 2025 10 2026 10 2027 9 2028 8 2029-2033 41 Total $ 87 NOTE 7 - LEASES The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company’s lease portfolio consists mainly of operating leases that expire at various dates through 2037. Information related to operating leases is as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets Operating lease right-of-use $ 429 $ 367 Operating lease liabilities Operating lease liability 71 68 Long-term operating lease liability 381 318 Total operating lease liabilities $ 452 $ 386 As of December 31, 2023 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 7 years Weighted average incremental borrowing rate 2.19 % 1.46 % Cash paid for operating leases $ 88 $ 76 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 161 $ 96 Rent expense was $102 million, $93 million and $74 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $2 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021. 57 The remaining maturity of existing lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Operating Leases 2024 $ 87 2025 87 2026 76 2027 66 2028 57 Thereafter 119 Total lease payments 492 Less interest (40) Present value of lease liabilities $ 452 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's finance leases and service contracts with lease arrangements were not material. Finance leases are reported in Property, buildings and equipment – net, and as a short and long-term finance lease liability in Accrued expenses and Other non-current liabilities.\nNOTE 8 - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS The Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to team members and executives, which include restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares and deferred stock units. As of December 31, 2023, there were 1.4 million shares available for grant under the plans. When awards are exercised or settled, shares of the Company’s treasury stock are issued.\nPretax stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A was $62 million, $48 million, and $42 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was primarily comprised of RSUs. Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $34 million, $19 million, and $21 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units The Company awards RSUs to certain team members and executives. RSUs vest generally over periods from one to seven years from issuance. The RSU grant date fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day preceding the date of the grant. RSU expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $43 million, $34 million and $30 million, respectively. The following table summarizes RSU activity (in millions of dollars, except for share and per share amounts): 2023 2022 2021 Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Beginning nonvested units 191,032 $ 409.77 202,321 $ 318.40 317,414 $ 259.67 Issued 81,174 $ 692.02 96,940 $ 520.67 105,866 $ 406.17 Canceled (7,943) $ 512.31 (17,038) $ 345.30 (36,134) $ 274.74 Vested (91,279) $ 384.92 (91,191) $ 336.99 (184,825) $ 276.34 Ending nonvested units 172,984 $ 550.62 191,032 $ 409.77 202,321 $ 318.40 Fair value of shares vested $ 35 $ 31 $ 51 As of December 31, 2023, there was $64 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 2 years. 58 NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Grainger currently enters into certain derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge against these risks, and may continue to do so in the future.\nFair Value Hedges The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt. These swaps are treated as fair value hedges and consequently the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense – net. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $450 million and $500 million, respectively.\nThe liability hedged by the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the hedged item, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments totaled $432 million and $466 million, respectively. The Company's interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of the Company's interest rate swaps were $16 million and $34 million, respectively.\nThe effect of the Company's fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in Interest expense – net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are shown in the following table (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Gain or (loss): Interest rate swaps: Hedged item $ (15) $ 35 Derivatives designated as hedging instrument $ 15 $ (35) Fair Value The estimated fair values of the Company's derivative instruments were based on quoted market forward rates, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy and reflect the present value of the amount that the Company would pay for contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates. 60 NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by geographical area consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 U.S.\n$ 2,211 $ 1,903 $ 1,267 Foreign 289 243 218 Total $ 2,500 $ 2,146 $ 1,485 Income tax expense consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Current income tax expense: U.S. Federal $ 431 $ 374 $ 221 U.S. State 100 77 46 Foreign 81 78 81 Total current 612 529 348 Deferred income tax (benefit) expense (15) 4 23 Total income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 The income tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the net deferred tax asset (liability) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses 177 150 U.S. and foreign loss carryforwards 84 62 Accrued employment-related benefits 51 51 Tax credit carryforward 22 26 Other 30 23 Deferred tax assets 364 312 Less valuation allowance (93) (71) Deferred tax assets – net of valuation allowance $ 271 $ 241 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, buildings, equipment and other capital assets (238) (212) Intangibles (58) (64) Inventory (11) (18) Other (11) (11) Deferred tax liabilities (318) (305) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) The net deferred tax asset (liability) is classified as follows: Noncurrent assets $ 10 $ 12 Noncurrent liabilities (foreign) (57) (76) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) 61 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $335 million and $248 million, respectively, of gross loss carryforwards related to foreign operations and U.S. transactions. Some of the loss carryforwards may expire at various dates through 2043. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance, which represents a provision for uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards and deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The Company's valuation allowance changed as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ (71) $ (70) Increases primarily related to foreign NOLs (5) (10) Releases primarily related to foreign NOLs 1 1 Foreign exchange rate changes (2) 4 Increase related to U.S. foreign tax credits 3 1 Increase related to capital loss carryforwards (19) — Other changes – net — 3 Balance at end of period $ (93) $ (71) A reconciliation of income tax expense with federal income taxes at the statutory rate follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Federal income tax $ 525 $ 451 $ 312 State income taxes – net of federal income tax benefit 74 64 41 Stock compensation (16) (5) (8) Foreign rate difference 31 26 26 Change in valuation allowance(1) 6 7 7 Other – net (23) (10) (7) Income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 Effective tax rate 23.9 % 24.8 % 25.0 % (1) Net of changes in related tax attributes.\nThe decrease to the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by increased tax benefits related to stock compensation. Foreign Undistributed Earnings Estimated gross undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $544 million and $530 million, respectively. The Company considers these undistributed earnings permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and is not recording a deferred tax liability for any foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. If at some future date the Company ceases to be permanently reinvested in its foreign subsidiaries, the Company may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on these undistributed earnings and may need to record a deferred tax liability for any outside basis difference in its investments in its foreign subsidiaries. 62 Tax Uncertainties The Company recognizes in the financial statements a provision for tax uncertainties, resulting from application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions. The changes in the liability for tax uncertainties, excluding interest, are as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 41 $ 38 $ 39 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 6 4 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 2 — Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) — (1) Reductions due to statute lapse (3) (2) (3) Settlements, audit payments, refunds – net (2) (1) — Balance at end of year $ 42 $ 41 $ 38 The Company classifies the liability for tax uncertainties in deferred income taxes and tax uncertainties. Included in this amount is $5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Any changes in the timing of deductibility of these items would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authorities to an earlier period. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the changes to tax positions were primarily related to the impact of expiring statutes and current year state and local reserves. The Company is regularly subject to examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service. The statute of limitations expired for the Company's 2019 federal tax return while tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open. The Company is also subject to audit by state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Tax years 2012 through 2022 remain subject to state and local audits and 2012 through 2022 remain subject to foreign audits. The amount of liability associated with the Company's tax uncertainties may change within the next 12 months due to the pending audit activity, expiring statutes or tax payments. A reasonable estimate of such change cannot be made. 63 NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions N.A. and Endless Assortment. The remaining businesses, which includes the Company's Cromwell business, are classified as Other to reconcile to consolidated results. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.\nThe Company's corporate costs are allocated to each reportable segment based on benefits received. Additionally, intersegment sales transactions, which are sales between Grainger businesses in separate reportable segments, are eliminated within the segment to present only the impact of sales to external customers. Service fees for intersegment sales are included in each segment's SG&A and are also eliminated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing is a summary of segment results (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 2021 Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 13,267 $ 2,334 $ 12,182 $ 1,983 $ 10,186 $ 1,334 Endless Assortment 2,916 233 2,787 223 2,576 232 Other 295 (2) 259 9 260 (19) Total Company $ 16,478 $ 2,565 $ 15,228 $ 2,215 $ 13,022 $ 1,547 2023 2022 2021 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense: High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 206 $ 168 $ 148 Endless Assortment 63 35 22 Other 8 3 3 Total $ 277 $ 206 $ 173 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense presented above includes long-lived assets, capitalized software and ROU assets.

Products are regularly added and removed from the Company's inventory. Accordingly, it would be impractical to provide sales information by product category due to the way the business is managed, and the dynamic nature of the inventory offered, including the evolving list of products stocked and additional products available online but not stocked. Assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker. 64 NOTE 14 - CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS From time to time the Company is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, including claims related to: product liability, safety or compliance; privacy and cybersecurity matters; negligence; contract disputes; environmental issues; unclaimed property; wage and hour laws; intellectual property; advertising and marketing; consumer protection; pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes); employment practices; regulatory compliance, including trade and export matters; anti-bribery and corruption; and other matters and actions brought by team members, consumers, competitors, suppliers, customers, governmental entities and other third parties.\nAs previously disclosed, between 2019 and 2021, Grainger, KMCO, LLC (KMCO) and other entities were named as defendants in various personal injury and property damage lawsuits in Harris County, Texas relating to an explosion at a KMCO chemical refinery in Crosby, Texas on April 2, 2019. The Company has since settled several of the personal injury lawsuits, including those alleging the most serious injuries. As previously disclosed, those settlements had no effect on net earnings or cash flows for prior quarters or years. The Company continues to contest the remaining KMCO-related lawsuits. The Company is currently unable to predict the timing, outcome or any estimate of possible loss or range of loss on the KMCO lawsuits. Also, as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local governmental entities, the Company may be subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to contract administration, pricing and product compliance.\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these proceedings and other matters, it believes that their ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nNOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 31, 2024, Grainger's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.86 per share of common stock, payable March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record on February 12, 2024. 65 Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.\nItem 9A: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosures and Controls The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.\nGrainger's management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment under that framework and the criteria established therein, Grainger's management concluded that Grainger's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to Grainger's internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Grainger's internal control over financial reporting. 66 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, W.W Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 67 Item 9B: Other Information None of the Company's directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's quarter ended December 31, 2023.

On one end of the spectrum are small distributors who offer local service but limited technology and geographic reach. On the other end are large suppliers with strong eCommerce platforms and national reach but limited local service. In this landscape, Fastenal stands apart in our ability to support customers with local service, comprehensive technology, and consistent capabilities on a global scale.\nThe goal is to help organizations reduce cost, risk, and growth constraints in their supply chains. The result: an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership for products purchased from Fastenal by an average of 21.2% (learn more on pg. 8).\nThese Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) programs represented 40.3% of total sales in 2023.\n95% of total revenue comes from customers utilizing more than one of our sales channels and tools, with 74% of total revenue coming from customers utilizing four or more.(3) Our local team operates in 3,419 in-market selling locations across 25 countries.\n64% of our $1.5B in inventory is staged locally or within customer sites for same-day access.\n1,597 public branches 1,822 Onsite locations Our local service is enhanced by a variety of technology solutions.\n56.1% of our total revenue flows through this “Digital Footprint.”(1) 113,138 weighted FASTBin/ FASTVend installations (MEUs(2)) MOVING FORWARD IN OUR ESG JOURNEY In the latter part of 2022, we achieved third-party certification to the ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management standard, the ISO/IEC 27001 information security management standard, and the ISO 14001 environmental management standard – all reflecting our core commitment to being a safe, secure, and sustainable organization.\nHaving completed an ESG materiality assessment in late 2022, we began 2023 by road-mapping our ESG strategy and building out our internal ESG Community of Practice to promote structured cross-departmental collaboration. In Q4 2023, we completed a scope 3 materiality assessment to broaden our understanding of our carbon inventory and guide future efforts to reduce our environmental impact.\nAs a result of our efforts and improved reporting on ESG matters, we received the 2023 Sustainability Award from Business Intelligence Group and made Newsweek’s 2024 list of America’s Greenest Companies. We finished the year by being awarded a silver medal from EcoVadis, signifying that our sustainability performance ranks in the top 25% of all companies in all industries assessed by EcoVadis.\nScan below to learn more about our ESG programs and progress.\nFASTVend™ Providing secure access and usage tracking close to the point of use in a customer’s facility.\nFASTBin™ Point-of-use devices with embedded technology providing a 24/7 sightline to the customer’s current inventory state.\nFASTStock SM Using mobile technology to illuminate inventory and simplify replenishment.\neCommerce Improves the efficiency of procurement/purchasing processes.

We have always operated under the premise there is no façade, and we openly share ourselves (warts included). To that end, we started sharing a section from the Blue Team Report, our internal annual report to employees, several years ago. Page three includes the lead-in letter from the current report.\nThe Fastenal culture could be characterized as a “glass half-full” mindset or, stated more directly, a “group of pragmatic optimists.” One of the goals in writing this year’s letter to employees, and in sharing some insight into our January 2024 earnings call, was to remind us of the work we’ve completed and to use this reminder as a means to shed some of the unneeded baggage that may have come along for the ride. Another goal was simply to reset our view towards our opportunity – a big market in need of a great supply chain partner like Fastenal. Shifting gears to our message to you, our valued shareholders, here are three items which were either noted in the earnings call or are relevant to a discussion about 2023 (and beyond). First, our global footprint has evolved. In 2022, our total international business exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In 2023, our international business in just the Americas exceeded $1 billion for the first time. This business is primarily in Canada and Mexico, and it’s operated with locally grown talent. Our international business outside the Americas continues to progress, and today we think of it as a $200-million business poised for the future.\nAt this size, the depth of employee talent is large enough to benefit from an increase in investment. The first step to this increased investment involved splitting our international business into two pieces – Americas (outside the United States) and Eurasia (Europe and Asia). We then elevated two successful international leaders to lead these new business units. Next, we challenged everyone within our supporting infrastructure, which is primarily United States-based, to spend some time traveling internationally and to actively invest more time and attention to helping their “international cousins.” Our international business units represent about 17% of our revenue and should receive at least 17% of our attention. Build for the future!\nSecond, we completed a large-scale multi-year branch optimization initiative in the United States, and to a lesser degree in Canada, which began a decade ago (and which occurred largely unnoticed). As highlighted in our January 2024 earnings call, our United States and Canada branch network peaked in 2013 at just over 2,600 locations. In 2013 and 2014, we had a slight reduction because we weren’t pushing the team to open branches. During this time, we also gained momentum with the expansion of our Onsite locations (the subset of our business dedicated to one customer versus a local market). There was a separate component of our business also gaining momentum: our industrial vending business (a service channel we now refer to as FASTVend, a subset of Fastenal Managed Inventory, or FMI). Since 2015, our local sales leadership actively contracted their branch network. To assist, we provided our district managers with a 10,000-foot view of the marketplace. (As noted, much of the reduction occurred in the United States. This subset represented about 2,400 of our 2,600 United States and Canadian locations a decade ago.) At our peak United States branch count, we estimate we were within a 30-minute drive of about 95% of the United States manufacturing marketplace. At today’s count of 1,441, we believe we still have 30-minute access to roughly 93.5% of the U.S. manufacturing marketplace (with a similar presence in Canada) based on our prior analysis of a target branch count of 1,450. The contraction lowered our occupancy expense in the field and was a necessary part of our Onsite expansion; however, the work of consolidating and relocating also distracted our local team. It’s nice to have this distraction behind us.\nThe branch optimization initiative was a major undertaking, but we believe the most significant change of the last decade is our expanded Onsite location network. (See the chart on the following page, which was previously provided in our January 2024 earnings call flip book.) The best way to think of our Onsite network is a business model adaptation that enhances our ability to pursue the total addressable market. In full disclosure, the Onsite network encompasses three main variations: (1) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in the customer’s facility, (2) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in a facility located near the customer site, or (3) a dedicated business unit primarily located in the back of an existing Fastenal branch. The latter two types are usually a result of a customer’s lack of space for us in their facility. We prefer option one but will adjust to any of the three.\nThe evolution of our branch and Onsite network unlocks our energy to pursue by freeing up time for greater engagement with our customers. It also allows us to lower our cost structure. The former is about inquiry and customer service, and the latter is about expanding the basket of products (or customer needs) available to us based on situational economics. (The operational efficiency of the Onsite model allows us to do and supply things for our customers that traditionally would not have been cost-effective.) Here is an example of the impact based on four of our oldest markets (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois). These four U.S. states represented about 19% of our global revenue in 2007 (our 40th year as a business). From 2007 to 2017, our revenue in this geography had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%, and our pre-tax earnings had a CAGR of 5.6%. In 2023, these four American states represented about 15% of our global revenue; and from 2017 to 2023, this revenue expanded to a CAGR of 8.2%, while our pre-tax earnings expanded to an 8.5% CAGR. Simply put, our local team enhanced our ability to grow in a very mature market by changing their approach. Part of the change involved reducing the number of branch locations in these four states by almost 30% versus a decade ago while expanding the Onsite location count roughly seven-fold. In these four states, our Onsite business grew from about 18% of revenue to about 46%. If we want to be more wonky on the view and look at our six oldest metropolitan markets touching these four states (Minneapolis, Madison, Milwaukee, Omaha, Des Moines, and Chicago), a similar story emerges. The branch count drop is slightly greater than 30%, and the Onsite count expansion is more pronounced, with a greater than 10-fold increase. Similarly, our CAGR for revenue and pre-tax earnings expanded, and the percent of our business operated through an Onsite expanded.\nTHANK YOU For Being a Shareholder of Fastenal Dan Florness President & Chief Executive Officer 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 1 Again, the details are a little wonky, but the point is simple: The Blue Team in these markets challenged the status quo, redefined their approach, and improved an already-great business. I believe this enhances our future potential in every market in which we operate. Time will demonstrate if this belief is correct.\nThe third and final item is our operating cash flow – i.e., the Net cash provided by operating activities line in our cash flow statement (and the ultimate health of a business’ long-term potential). The improvement to operating cash flow we enjoyed in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in 2023. For background, during 2021 and most of 2022, we dramatically increased our inventory to support our customers in a period plagued by global supply bottlenecks. As conditions started to improve in late 2022, we started to unwind this inventory expansion. Given the cash flow dynamics of a distribution business, this unwind dramatically improved our operating cash flow.\nThis cash belongs to you – thank you for giving us the opportunity to use it over the last several years to support our customers. The cash was sent to you in the form of a supplemental dividend paid in December 2023, the fourth such supplemental dividend in our history. (The other three were explained in greater detail in last year’s letter to shareholders.) Rest assured, this supplemental dividend is a statement about confidence in the business, not about opportunities to invest.\nWe believe our ability to generate cash in the future, and our ability to supplement available cash with debt if needed (given our conservative balance sheet), will allow us to invest in opportunities as we continue our pursuit of Growth Through Customer Service.\nGood luck in 2024, and thank you for your belief in the Blue Team at Fastenal.\nGo Blue!\nDANIEL L. FLORNESS President and Chief Executive Officer • Total in-market(1) locations were 3,419 at end of 4Q23, up 3.4% from 3,306 at 4Q Our total in-market location count continues grow due to a rising installed base of Onsit In 2015, Onsites constituted 9.1% of our market locations; in 2023, they were 53.3% • Our Onsite business began with a custom request 20+ years ago. Over time, t morphed into our Onsite business model. T prompted us to revisit our branch netw density, which we began to reduce in 2013.\n• Over the last several years we have stated U.S./Canada network would likely tre toward 1,450 traditional branches. We end 2023 with 1,441 branches in the U.S./Cana markets and believe our branch count remain between 1,400 and 1,500.\n• At our peak United States branch count 2013, we believe we had 30-minute access 95.0% of the U.S. manufacturing base. Bas on prior analysis of a target branch count 1,450, we believe we still have 30-min access to roughly 93.5% of the U manufacturing base.

Come to think of it, Bob Kierlin already did – it’s titled The Power of Fastenal People. It’s an interesting read, and I would highly recommend it. Even if you’ve read it before, a refresher never hurts. To be honest, every employee in Fastenal (me included) would have been well served to have read it in 2022 and in 2023. It would have reminded us how important it is to (1) support each other and (2) stay focused on our common goal. As it turned out, we wavered on both fronts, and as a result, we underperformed in both years.\nIt wasn’t as obvious in 2022. The global economy was mending from the pandemic, supply chains were constrained, and inflation was running hot. Our strength in supply chain really shined through, and we grew well; however, under the surface we knew we were losing something. We started to forget about our priorities and purpose, and we became a bit too focused on ourselves. As 2023 progressed, it became apparent, and then a weaker global marketplace amplified the problem.\nThere’s a quote credited to Winston Churchill from the World War II era, and it goes something like this: “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.” I’m not sure why this quote popped into my head, but it seemed to aptly describe the Blue Team’s approach to 2023. The good news: After some soul searching and structural changes, we’ve progressed from “tried everything else” to “do the right thing,” which for us means refocusing on our core strengths as an organization.\nFastenal has a superpower. I believe the essence of this power can be summarized as our ability to find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. In an era when it’s easy to find differences and separation, we excel at the opposite, and the members of the Blue Team cherish the unique humanness in each other. We also care enough to push each other to learn, to change, and to grow; and this creates a winning culture. Yes, we sometimes drive each other crazy with our speed of change, but that’s okay – our customers like this about us. We harness this superpower every day by remembering some simple truths: 1. Get everyone pursuing a common goal and you can accomplish great things. 2. Understand our obligations to each other.\n3. Goals matter!\nThe first truth is about our desire to deliver great customer service, knowing the market’s reward for this service is growth. As alluded to above, we lost sight of this truth in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, our common goal is serving the customer well. Fortunately, our motto is easy to remember: Growth Through Customer Service.\nThe second truth is understanding our obligations to each other. We directly serve our customers through the local Blue Team in our branch and Onsite network. Everyone else provides the assist by focusing on helping the local Blue Team. This keeps it simple, and we find success together.\nIf you listen to our quarterly earnings calls, you might have been taken aback by the bluntness in our January 18th call. Don’t get me wrong, we provided some context by discussing the weak economy: 14 consecutive months of economic contraction in the manufacturing sector, as indicated by a sub-50 Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), the longest period of contraction since the Great Recession. But we spent more time discussing our poor execution and the steps taken to address the problem.\nOn this and on earlier calls we spoke about some needed course corrections, and about asking some people to step into new roles. We also spoke about the positives – our success with FMI, our celebration of 20 years in China (and my recent visit to the Blue Team there to recognize the milestone), and our upcoming ten-year celebration in India. If the schedule works out, I hope to visit our Blue Team in India later this year.\nSpeaking of new roles, Jeff Watts (who was promoted to chief sales officer in 2023) laid out three simple concepts for 2024 when he spoke at our recent Employee Expo: (1) Alignment – working together toward a common goal, (2) Accountability – embracing a culture of ownership, and (3) Execution – translating plans into action. The concepts are simple and direct.\nAs we move into 2024, I’m excited by what I see: We are focused on our strength: driving planned/managed spend. We are acknowledging and addressing our deficiencies: improving our capabilities around unplanned/unmanaged spend. This includes addressing weakness in our eCommerce capabilities and creating PO automation to simplify daily processes. We’re also improving our knowledge capabilities (i.e., IT/data capabilities) to view our business through a holistic “customer” lens versus an individual “account” lens. We have a clear sales focus: Target 5, Onsite growth, FMI, and the Customer Solutions Consultant (CSC) program. We’ve also simplified the language we use to describe our diverse customer base: “contract” and “non-contract” customers.\nEarlier I mentioned a recent trip to China (so recent I’m still experiencing a bit of jet lag). There were many highlights from the trip – meeting the team in person, seeing their facilities and how they support their local customers and their Blue Team cousins across the globe, spending time with a long-term supplier. However, what stood out to me is the number of people recognized for five, ten, fifteen, and twenty years of service. We are still a very young organization in China, and it’s amazing how many people have decided to make Fastenal a career.\nAs always, good luck in 2024 … and GO BLUE!\nDANIEL L.

Financial Highlights 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 5 As of January 19, 2024, there were approximately 900 record holders of our common stock, which includes nominees or broker dealers holding stock on behalf of an estimated 662,000 beneficial owners.\nIn 2023 and 2022, we paid dividends per share totaling $1.78 and $1.24, respectively. This included a special dividend of $0.38 per share paid in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. On January 17, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share to be paid on February 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2024. Our board of directors intends to continue paying quarterly dividends; however, any future determination as to payment of dividends will depend upon the financial condition and results of operations of the company and such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of directors.\nIn 2023, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $47.58 per share.\nThe following chart displays the daily closing sales price of our shares listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the last two years.\n2022 Nasdaq: FAST 2023 (1) Gross cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Approximately 36 years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split eight times, had become 192,000 shares worth $12,435,840, for a gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $2,285,664 in dividends since August 20, 1987, for a total gain of approximately 22.8% compounded annually.\nTen Years On December 31, 2013, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $47,500. Ten years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 10.6% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $18,960 in dividends since December 2013, for a total gain of approximately 12.1% compounded annually.\nFive Years On December 31, 2018, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $52,300. Five years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 19.9% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $12,820 in dividends since December 2018, for a total gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually.\nDividends We have paid dividends in every year since 1991, and quarterly dividends since 2011. In addition, Fastenal paid a special one-time dividend during December 2023, 2020, 2012, and 2008.\nA Simple Philosophy Since going public in 1987, we have maintained a consistent focus on avoiding, if feasible, the potentially dilutive impact of our activities on our shareholders. To this end, we have grown our organization principally with internal cash flow, have supported the Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan with stock purchased in the open market, and, since creating a stock option program in 2003, have periodically purchased common stock in the open market to, among other things, offset the potential impact of our stock option grants. We have purchased approximately 54.4 million shares since 2003 and have granted our employees options to purchase approximately 32.4 million shares. (Note: These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of stock splits.) This has allowed us to balance internal investment with cash returns to shareholders. For example, in the last five years we have enjoyed total sales of $31,319 million and total pre-tax earnings of $6,346 million. During this same time period, we spent approximately $5,636 million to compensate a group of great employees, we supported our customers’ needs by adding approximately $617 million in operational working capital assets (accounts receivable, net, plus inventory) and by spending approximately $869 million in net capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds of sales), and we returned $3,964 million to our shareholders. The latter was principally through dividends (approximately $3,674 million), with the remainder through share purchases. A final point worth noting: We are an important element of the tax base in the many communities in which we operate. During the last five years, we have incurred approximately $1,529 million in income taxes, or approximately 24.1% of the pre-tax earnings noted above, and incurred or remitted approximately $1,465 million in employment taxes, $68 million in property taxes, $1,023 million in sales, use, and value-added taxes, and $5 million in other miscellaneous business-related taxes. This adds up to a total of approximately $4.1 billion in taxes funded in our communities.\n1,000 shares ($9,000) invested on August 20, 1987 Value on December 31, 2023: $12,435,840 Stock Split Stock Performance Highlights (1), (2) 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 7 CREATING VALUE AND MEASURING THE IMPACT Average TCO Savings Opportunity* This is the high-level finding of a study of 445 vetted TCO Analysis exercises.\nBelow is a look at some of the drivers behind this headline number.\n21.2% 39% average reduction in inventory carrying cost 61% average reduction in cost associated with material handling/distribution 32% average reduction in transportation cost 56% average vendor reduction 36% average reduction in employee travel time 47% average reduction in the cost to source products 20% average consumption reduction through vending Accepted industry average (not based on our internal study) Fastenal’s solution-based approach stems from a simple truth: Every minute or dollar our customers spend procuring, managing, owning, or accessing supplies is a minute or dollar they aren’t spending on value-creating activities. Our job is to help them minimize those sources of waste, and it often starts with a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis. This includes (1) mapping how products are procured, moved, staged, and used in their facilities; (2) quantifying the costs surrounding those activities; and (3) presenting a tailored set of solutions to help them achieve specific TCO reduction goals for the products in scope. * This average TCO savings opportunity is based on an assumption of the customers’ full adoption of our suggested services and solutions. Vetted opportunities meet the following criteria: (1) the conductor of the TCO Analysis (a trained Fastenal Lean Six Sigma specialist) has confirmed the validity of the data entered; (2) 70% or more of the TCO Analysis data is customer-specific, not based on industry averages; and (3) the data was accepted/agreed upon by the customer during or after the TCO Analysis presentation.\nThe takeaway: By helping customers operate more efficiently and productively, our role is elevated from “supplier of products” to “strategic partner in the business.” This focus on value creation and documentation allows us to build exceptionally strong relationships, maintain resilient revenue streams, and widen our competitive moat.\n8 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 10-K (Mark One) ☒ Annual report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or ☐ Transition report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the transition period from to Commission file number 0-16125 FASTENAL COMPANY (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Minnesota 41-0948415 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization) (I.R.S.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other reports of the company and other written and oral statements made from time to time by the company, do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. As such, they are considered 'forward-looking statements' that provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, may, will, plan, goal, project, hope, trend, target, opportunity, and similar words or expressions, or by references to typical outcomes. Any statement that is not a purely historical fact, including estimates, projections, trends, and the outcome of events that have not yet occurred, is a forward-looking statement. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our expectations regarding the business environment in which we operate, our projections of future performance and opportunities for growth based on potential market opportunities, our perceived marketplace opportunities, our strategies, goals, mission and vision, and our expectations about matters including capital expenditures, tax rates, inventory levels, liquidity, liabilities from tax positions, the performance of our fastener business in comparison to our non-fastener business, openings and closing of in-market locations and signings of Onsite locations and new machine equivalent units for Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) (including bin stock and industrial vending) and the competitive advantages they offer, our digital solutions and other product offerings (including new product lines), national accounts as a percentage of overall sales, the advantages of our integrated physical and virtual model, growth in safety products as a percentage of product sales, the amount of FMI revenue that we may be able to service through local inventory fulfillment terminals, and the ability of our competitors to replicate our distribution capabilities. You should understand that forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, economic downturns (including economic downturns as a result of global pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic), weakness in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, competitive pressure on selling prices, changes in trade policies or tariffs, changes in our current mix of products, customers, or geographic locations, changes in our average branch size, changes in our purchasing patterns, changes in customer needs, changes in fuel or commodity prices, product and transportation inflation, inclement weather, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, difficulty in adapting our business model to different foreign business environments, failure to accurately predict the market potential of our business strategies, the introduction or expansion of new business strategies, increased competition (including with respect to our FMI or Onsite operations), difficulty in maintaining installation quality as our industrial vending business expands, the failure to meet our goals and expectations regarding expansion of our FMI or Onsite operations or any changes in branch locations, changes in the implementation objectives of our business strategies, difficulty in hiring, relocating, training, or retaining qualified personnel, difficulty in controlling operating expenses, difficulty in collecting receivables or accurately predicting future inventory needs, changes in sales trends, changes in supplier production lead times, changes in our cash position or our need to make capital expenditures, credit market volatility and increases in interest rates, changes in tax law or the impact of discrete items on future tax rates, changes in the availability or price of commercial real estate, changes in the nature, price, or availability of distribution, supply chain, or other technology (including software licensed from third parties) and services related to that technology, difficulty in obtaining continued business from new safety product customers and the acceptance by customers of any new product lines, cyber security incidents, potential liability and reputational damage that can arise if our products are defective, and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10-K under the heading 'Item 1A. Risk Factors'. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date.\nPRESENTATION OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS All dollar amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in millions, except for share and per share amounts or where otherwise noted. Throughout this document, percentage and dollar change calculations, which are based on non-rounded dollar values, may not be able to be recalculated using the dollar values in this document due to the rounding of those dollar values.

The year end is December 31, 2023 unless additional years are included or noted.\nOverview Fastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as 'Fastenal' or the company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population today of approximately 26,000. We began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small, medium, and, in subsequent years, large cities. Over time, how and where we engage our customers has expanded and evolved. Today we sell a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines through a global network of in-market locations utilizing diverse technologies such as vending devices, bin stock devices, and eCommerce. The large majority of our transactions are business-to-business. We provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document. At the end of 2023, we had 3,419 in-market locations (defined in the table below) in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in North America (12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico), and two in Europe, and we employed 23,201 people. We believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers, and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement.\nOur Channels to Market We engage our customers primarily through branch and Onsite locations. Branches and Onsites exist very close to our customers, usually within miles in the case of the former and most often within or immediately proximate to our customers' physical locations in the case of the latter, and together constitute our 'in-market' network. Many of our customers engage with us through eCommerce, but in most cases these customers are utilizing eCommerce to supplement our service through our other channels.\nThe following table shows, as of the end of each of the last 10 fiscal years, our consolidated net sales; the number of branch, Onsite, and total in-market locations; their respective sales, as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and Onsite locations; and our revenue generated from non-traditional sources: 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 6,010.9 5,647.3 5,333.7 4,965.1 4,390.5 3,962.0 3,869.2 3,733.5 Branch locations 1,597 1,683 1,793 2,003 2,114 2,227 2,383 2,503 2,622 2,637 Branch revenue (1) $ 4,073.6 4,161.6 3,726.2 3,587.1 3,660.1 3,625.8 3,399.6 3,198.1 3,281.8 3,225.3 Average monthly sales per branch location (2) $ 207.0 199.5 163.6 145.2 140.5 131.1 116.0 104.0 104.0 101.0 Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 1,416 1,265 1,114 894 605 401 264 214 Onsite revenue (1) $ 2,926.7 2,465.5 1,898.0 1,485.6 1,391.7 1,081.7 770.2 569.2 454.3 387.7 Average monthly sales per Onsite location (2) $ 141.6 135.2 118.0 104.1 115.5 120.3 127.6 142.7 158.4 157.6 Other revenue (3) $ 346.4 353.5 386.7 574.6 281.9 257.6 220.7 194.7 133.1 120.5 Total in-market locations (4) 3,419 3,306 3,209 3,268 3,228 3,121 2,988 2,904 2,886 2,851 (1) Revenues attributable to our traditional and international branch locations (both of which are defined below), and our Onsite locations, respectively.\n(2) Average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and Onsites, respectively, in the given year, factoring in the beginning and ending location count, divided by total revenues attributable to our branch and Onsite locations, respectively, further divided by 12 months. This information is presented in thousands.\n(3) This portion of revenue is generated outside our traditional in-market locations, examples of which include revenues arising from our custom in-house manufacturing, industrial services, and other non-traditional sources of revenue. In 2020, this included the effects of COVID-19, one response to which was substantial sales of pandemic-related products that were direct-shipped (versus sold through in-market locations) as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly.\n(4) 'In-market locations' is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of Onsite locations.\n2 This structure has evolved over time as a result of one of Fastenal's guiding principles since inception: that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer. This has been achieved by opening branch locations and, more recently, Onsite locations. Today, we believe there are few companies that offer our North American in-market location coverage. In 2023, roughly 52% of our sales and 51% of our in-market locations were in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (populations in the United States and Canada greater than 500,000 people), while 21% of our sales and 19% of our in-market locations were in small MSAs (populations under 500,000 people), and 27% of our sales and 30% of our in-market locations were not in an MSA. In our view, this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis. Maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers' operations have represented, and continue to represent, the foundation of our service approach. We have two primary versions of our branch locations: 1) A 'traditional branch' typically services a wide variety of customers, ranging from the local operations of large, national account customers to smaller local businesses. Based on the unique characteristics of certain markets, some traditional branches will be structured and stocked to service retail customers. Locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network and employment and production data for manufacturing and non-residential construction companies. We stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and tailored by our district and branch personnel to the needs of the local customer base. Since Fastenal's founding and through 2013, traditional branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company, and we experienced net openings each year over that time span. However, new growth drivers, business models, and business tools have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth. Traditional branches were entirely U.S.-based until 1994, when we opened our first location in Canada. At the end of 2023, we had 1,441 traditional branches in the United States and Canada, and they represented 51.0% of net sales.\nTraditional branches are also differentiated by their operating styles. Certain locations are Customer Service Branches (CSBs), which tend to feature a showroom and our standard stocking model of products designed for contractors. CSBs often conduct some business with non-account or retail-like customers. However, this customer set typically represents less than 10% of sales at this type of location. Other locations operate as Customer Fulfillment Centers (CFCs), which tend to feature a limited showroom and stock customer-specific inventory. These tend to appear and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location and often have fewer transactions with non-account or retail-like customers than in a CSB branch. The choice of operating style is made by local leadership and is based on local market considerations. At the end of 2023, 15% of our traditional branches operated as a CSB and 85% operated as a CFC.\n2) An 'international branch' is the format we typically deploy outside the United States and Canada. We first expanded outside of the United States and Canada when we opened a branch in Mexico in 2001. Since then, we have continued to expand our global footprint, and at the end of 2023, we operated in 23 countries outside of the United States and Canada. Mexico is the largest of these, and we also operate in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Our go-to-market strategy in countries outside of the United States and Canada focuses primarily on servicing large, national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing and heavily oriented toward planned fastener and non-fastener product spend. We are not as well recognized in many of our non-North American locations as we are in the U.S. and Canada. However, our ability to provide a consistent service model, including vending, bin stocks, and Onsites, on a global basis is attractive to our customer base, much of which are the foreign operations of North American-based companies. At the end of 2023, we had 156 international branches operating outside the U.S. and Canada, and they represented 4.5% of net sales.\nTraditional and international branches sell to multiple customers. In each year since 2013, we have experienced a net decline in our total branch count, primarily due to consolidations in our U.S. market, including net declines of 86 branches in 2023. Our total decline since 2013 is 1,090 branches. We will continue to open traditional and international branches in accordance with our overall strategy. We believe the strategic rationalization that has produced a significant decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. Onsite locations may influence the trend in our traditional branch count over time, but have not been the primary reason for our traditional branch closings. The Onsite concept is not new, in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992. However, it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014. We have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015. In this model, we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within, or strategically proximate to, the customers' facility, with inventory that is specific to the customers' needs. In many cases, we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch location, though we also see new customer opportunities arise as a result of our Onsite capabilities. The model is best suited for larger companies, though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors. It has been our experience that the sales mix at our Onsite locations typically produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations, but we gain revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is lower. We have identified over 12,000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in North America with potential to implement the Onsite service model. These include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today, and 3 potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today. However, as awareness of our capabilities has grown, we have identified additional Onsite potential with certain agencies of state, provincial, and local government customers, and academia. We also believe as we follow our existing national account customers outside the United States, our market potential for Onsite solutions will continue to expand. The international opportunity is substantial, but our speed is limited by our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the United States. We expect revenues from Onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time. We had 1,822 Onsite locations as of December 31, 2023, which represented 39.8% of net sales, and signed 326, 356, and 274 new Onsite locations (referred to herein as signings) in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the branches and Onsite locations we operated at the end of each year, as well as the openings, closings, and conversions during each year: North America Outside North America United States (1) Canada Mexico Subtotal Central & South America (2) Asia (3) Europe (4) Subtotal Total In-Market Locations - 12/31/21 (5) 2,668 262 152 3,082 20 37 70 127 3,209 Starting Branches 1,484 173 63 1,720 5 20 48 73 1,793 Opened Branches — 1 4 5 — 2 5 7 12 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (115) (5) (1) (121) — — (1) (1) (122) Ending Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Starting Onsites 1,184 89 89 1,362 15 17 22 54 1,416 Opened Onsites 248 21 23 292 1 6 7 14 306 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (94) (3) (1) (98) — — (1) (1) (99) Ending Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 In-Market Locations - 12/31/22 2,707 276 177 3,160 21 45 80 146 3,306 Starting Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Opened Branches — — 3 3 — 3 4 7 10 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (92) (5) — (97) — — 1 1 (96) Ending Branches 1,277 164 69 1,510 5 25 57 87 1,597 Starting Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 Opened Onsites 283 18 20 321 — 1 7 8 329 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (115) (6) (3) (124) (1) (2) (3) (6) (130) Ending Onsites 1,506 119 128 1,753 15 22 32 69 1,822 In-Market Locations - 12/31/23 2,783 283 197 3,263 20 47 89 156 3,419 (1) Includes the United States, the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n(2) Includes Panama, Brazil, and Chile.\n(3) Includes Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n(4) Includes the Netherlands, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, France, and Belgium.\n(5) Beginning in 2022, the United States includes the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico which were previously grouped with other geographical regions. Prior period figures in the above table may differ slightly from those previously disclosed due to this minor change in reporting. (6) The net impact of non-in-market locations or Onsite locations converted to branches, branches converted to Onsite locations or non-in-market locations, and closures of branches or Onsite locations.\nWe believe the profitability of our in-market locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site. In any in-market location, certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable, such as employee-related expenses, while others, like rent and utility costs, tend to be fixed. As a result, it has been shown that as an in-market location increases its sales base over time, it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin. This ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by: (1) general growth based on end market expansion and/or market share gains, (2) the age of the in-market location (new locations tend to be less profitable due to start-up costs and, in the case of a traditional branch, the time necessary to generate a customer base), and/or (3) rationalization actions, as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional 4 branch base. There are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location. Key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market, factories may have closed, our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches, and/or our customers may have transitioned to our Onsite model. An Onsite location may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise, in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local traditional branch. The paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an Onsite location, as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage, while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employee-related expenses. In the short term, the Onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged.\nWe utilize additional types of selling locations within our network, but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number, comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations. We remain committed to a large, robust service network, including traditional branches, international branches, and Onsites; it remains the indispensable foundation of our business. With the growth we anticipate in Onsite locations, we believe our total in-market locations will increase further over time.\nOur Business Tools Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) Over time, we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location, increase the visibility of a customer's supply chain (to the customer as well as our personnel), and/or improve the ability to monitor or control usage. While there are isolated exceptions, these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and Onsite channels to enhance service to our customers. Collectively, these tools comprise our Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) Technology suite. We believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers. FMI programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and, coupled with our fully integrated distribution network, foster a strong relationship with customers.\nBin stock (FASTStock℠ and FASTBin®) programs, where product is held in bins in a customer facility, are similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities. Such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time, with open bins being clustered in a racking system, each of which holds original equipment manufacturing (OEM) fasteners, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) fasteners, and/ or non-fastener products that are consumed in the customers' operations. Historically, these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or Fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need. These bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customized digital plan-o-grams, which we call FASTStock and allow for the scanning of product when it is at a minimum desired level. However, in 2019 we introduced our FASTBin technology. FASTBin is the evolution of FASTStock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 24/7 continuous inventory monitoring, real-time inventory visibility, and more efficient replenishment of bin stock parts. These technologies come in three forms: (1) scales that utilize a high-precision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum; (2) infrared (IR) that uses infrared sensors lining individual bins to provide real-time visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum threshold; and (3) RFID, which is a Kanban system that utilizes RFID tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone (also part of the same racking system), a notification is sent to Fastenal to refill the order. These technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes, allowing for a lean supply chain, reducing risk of stock-outs, and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier.\nIndustrial vending (FASTVend®) was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control. Benefits include reduced consumption, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability. We believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive in-market network of inventory and local personnel. For these reasons, the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011, and we finished 2023 with approximately 111,800 FASTVend non-weighted devices in the field. We believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized. We also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base of devices before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support. We estimate the market could support as many as 1.7 million vending units and, as a result, we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time.\n5 Our industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices, with 16 of these being in either a helix or locker format. Our most utilized models include the helix-based FAST 5000 and our 12- and 18-door lockers; combined, these comprise approximately 66% of our installed base of devices. These are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers. Target monthly revenues per device typically range from under $1,000 to in excess of $3,000, with our flagship FAST 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of $2,000. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we began to report a weighted FMI measure which combines the signings and installations of FASTBin and FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We do not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins, shelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. This conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each FMI device signed or installed and compares it to the $2,000 target monthly throughput of our FAST 5000 vending device. For example, an RFID enclosure, with target monthly revenue of $2,000 would be counted as '1.00' machine equivalent ($2,000/$2,000 = 1.00). An infrared bin, with target monthly revenue of $40, would be counted as '0.02' machine equivalent ($40/$2,000 = 0.02).\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Change Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs) 24,126 20,735 16.4% Signings per day 95 82 Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period) 113,138 102,151 10.8% FASTStock sales $ 927.6 832.0 11.5% % of sales 12.5% 11.8% FASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 2,070.2 1,755.3 17.9% % of sales 27.8% 24.9% FMI sales $ 2,997.8 2,587.3 15.9% FMI daily sales $ 11.8 10.2 16.3% % of sales 40.3% 36.7% Digital Solutions We also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers, leverage local inventory for same-day solutions, and provide efficient service. While there is a transactional element to our digital services, many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain. These solutions take many forms: 1) Transactional. Our transactional, or eCommerce, platforms (web verticals or integrated catalogs) provide a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure MRO and unplanned spend. While there is a retail component to our transactional digital services, most of the revenue attributable to this is with our traditional customer base, nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools that it utilizes with Fastenal. We attribute the revenue generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the in-market location that traditionally services that customer location. 2) Digital Visibility. Certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves and/or to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chain operations. For instance, we have developed, and continue to develop, 'Mobility' applications, one example of which is our Vending App, which provides a number of benefits. It provides easy, real-time information pertaining to a customer's local inventory position within their point-of-use devices. It incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices, which improves customer inventories while reducing the risk of stock-outs. Moving our fulfillment process from a vending device-based keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process (reduced risk of product outages), reducing time consumed (greater efficiency) while improving accuracy (improved quality assurance). We will continue to build out our suite of Mobility applications. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), is the connectivity between our system and our customers' procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system or through a third-party procurement network or marketplace. These solutions provide a system-to-system exchange of electronic procurement documents (such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices for direct and indirect spend). Our eProcurement Solutions provide a bridge between our FMI replenishment activity and our customers' procurement systems – creating an efficient, accurate and streamlined procure-to-pay (P2P) process. FAST360° acts as the bridge between our FMI footprint and a 6 customer's view into our managed service model. FAST360° surfaces data around these managed services as one central source of information as we manage our customers' OEM and MRO product lines. This is achieved through our FMI technologies providing locational data around our FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend footprint, and FAST360° being the means of surfacing that data and activities to our customers. 3) Analytics. We provide solutions-based digital platforms (e.g., web verticals or integrated catalogs) which leverage our existing strategic environment by creating a means of migrating online spend offline, which illuminates our supply chain capabilities. This is marketed under the FAST360° Analytics label, as it is an enterprise-centric extension of the digital visibility capabilities of FAST360°. We bring value to our customers, as well as ourselves, by using these digital platforms and analytics to shift product from a 'non-sticky' transactional environment (which is online) to a 'sticky' strategic environment (which is our FMI programs). We create customer cost savings opportunities through this directive by lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) as the objective is to shrink the unplanned (and traditionally high cost), purely transactional spend bucket.\nDigital Footprint Our digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that proportion of our eCommerce sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both ourselves and our customers. As a result, we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities. Our Digital Footprint represented 56.1% of sales in 2023.\nWe believe our integrated physical and virtual model, when paired with our national (and increasingly international) scope, represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to eCommerce as an independent sales channel. We expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time. Our greatest opportunity lies with the deployment of efficient and effective supply chain programs. We are focused on addressing the four key components of people, products, processes, and technology to support this model. We believe our global channels to market and business tools, including those that we consider to be growth drivers (Onsites, international expansion, FMI, and digital solutions), represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups. These means get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed. This is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and 'sticky' service. Combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling (in-market and otherwise) and non-selling (engineering, product specialists, manufacturing, etc.) employees, we offer a range of capabilities that are difficult for large and small competitors to replicate.\nDistribution Network We operate 15 regional distribution centers in North America: 12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico. We also operate two distribution centers in Europe. These distribution centers give us approximately 5.0 million square feet of distribution capacity. Additional details on these locations can be found within the 'Item 2. Properties' section of this Form 10-K. These distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our in-market locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier, with approximately 74% of our North American in-market locations receiving service four to five times per week. The distribution centers in Indiana and Kansas also serve as 'master' hubs, with those in California and North Carolina serving as 'secondary' hubs to support the needs of the in-market locations in their geographic regions as well as to provide a broader selection of products for the in-market locations serviced by the other distribution centers. We currently operate 11 of our North American distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency, and currently handle approximately 94% of our picking activity. We expect to invest in additional automation technologies, expand existing distribution facilities, and/or add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our in-market locations increases.\n7 We also utilize a network of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) which reside within our existing distribution centers and are intended to support areas that have a dense population of FMI devices. Traditionally, branch personnel were solely responsible for stocking and packaging inventory, delivering to a customer's location, and refilling the customer's devices. As our sales through FMI devices have grown, this approach has resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnel's time being spent on non-sales activities. We primarily utilize a 'drop-and-deliver' model wherein a LIFT is responsible for stocking and packaging FMI supplies, producing inventory and accuracy benefits, and delivering them to the business unit, where delivery and replenishment is then performed by local district or branch personnel. In a minority of cases we deploy a 'drop-and-scatter' model, wherein delivery and replenishment is also performed by LIFT personnel. In 2023, approximately 8% of our FMI revenue was serviced through a LIFT, but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40% of our FMI revenue.\nTransportation The ability to move product, globally and domestically, from our sources of supply to our customers is critical to the competitiveness of our business model. We utilize multiple modes of transportation to support our business model.\nWe transport product from our global manufacturing and supplier partners to our distribution centers. Related costs range from port fees, duties, costs related to container and shipper services, and inland trucking and intermodal charges. We consider these expenses to be a part of our landed product cost, and significant fluctuations are typically addressed through product pricing.\nWe transport product between our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our in-market locations. We typically transport approximately 90% of our products on our own fleet of Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks, with the remainder being on third party shippers. Costs range from lease charges, driver pay, fuel costs to support our captive fleet, and fees paid to third-party shippers. These expenses are included in cost of goods sold but are not considered a part of our landed product cost, with fluctuations typically addressed by applying freight charges to customer purchases and by securing commercial back-hauls. We primarily lease our trucks, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 520 units.\nWe transport product from our in-market locations to our customers on a fleet of pick-up, box, and other trucks. Expenses to maintain this fleet are considered selling-related transportation costs, which include lease charges, depreciation, and fuel, and are typically reflected in all other operating and administrative expenses. We have a mix of leased and owned vehicles, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 10,200 units. Information Systems Our Information Systems teams develop, implement, secure, and maintain the computer-based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, digital, distribution center, and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations, while each selling location uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of custom in-house developed, purchased, and subscription licensed software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.\nTrademarks and Service Marks We conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and taglines in connection with each of these marks, including Where Industry Meets Innovation™. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the 'Fastenal' name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, various trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the United States as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.\nProducts Fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies. This includes threaded fasteners, bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers, as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as pins, machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories. Our fastener product line, which is primarily sold under the Fastenal product name, represented 32.4% of our consolidated sales in 2023. Fastener distribution is complex. In most cases, the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight. This presents challenges in moving product from suppliers, most of whom are outside of North America, to our distribution centers, as well as from our distribution centers to our branch, Onsite, and customer locations. At the same time, fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products, construction projects, and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application. In many cases, a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime and/or effective use. These features have greatly influenced our logistical development, training and educational programs, support capabilities, and inventory decisions, which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate.\n8 In 1993, we began to aggressively add additional product lines, and these represented 67.6% of our consolidated sales in 2023. These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending. The most significant category of non-fastener products is our safety supplies product line, which accounted for 21.2% of our consolidated sales in 2023. This product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last 10 years, which we believe is directly attributable to our success cross-selling safety supplies to customers that utilize us for non-safety products as well as our ability to market, deploy, and service industrial vending over that period. We expect these variables to remain the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line. We plan to continue to add other product lines in the future.\nIn the last several decades, we have added 'private label' brands (often referred to as 'Exclusive Brands', or brands sold exclusively through Fastenal) to our non-fastener offering. Prior to 2023, each of our product categories tended to have its own private label. In 2023, we consolidated these into two labels: Body Guard®, which is our long-standing brand for North American safety supplies, and ORMADUS®, which is our global brand encompassing the remainder of our product offerings. These private label brands represented approximately 13% of our consolidated sales in 2023. We believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 19% of our total non-fastener sales in 2023. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices. Detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K. Each product line may contain multiple product categories. Inventory Control Our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, by our district and regional leadership, and by our product development team. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 64% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 36% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations In 2023, approximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome®, Cardinal Fasteners®, and Spensall® product lines. The services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\n9 Sources of Supply We use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. During 2023, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products, our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. Approximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses fabricated products, heavy machinery, petrochemical, mining and aerospace and includes both OEM and MRO customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation (transportation services, such as air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as fulfillment centers) and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other, interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of revenue tends to be impacted by cyclical changes, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nOur national accounts program is aimed at creating contractual agreements with single or multi-location customers. These contractual programs are intended to help improve our customers' supply chains by identifying productivity and efficiency gains throughout their organization. The scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that these companies need to manage is very complex and costly. We believe that our broad product offering coupled with our ability to execute and curate a dedicated service model for each of their sites provides us with a unique advantage and allows us to provide them with a total cost of ownership benefit. Additionally, our local presence as part of a national, and increasingly international, footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. We believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands. As a result, in 2023, national accounts represented 60.3% of our consolidated sales, compared to 57.8% and 56.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales over time. In an in-market location, we track our customers' business activity through 'active accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2023, we averaged 105,448 active accounts per month and approximately 99.4% of the sales in our in-market locations are derived from our active accounts (the remainder was from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers). Traditionally, our in-market locations, particularly our traditional and international branches, prioritized acquiring additional active accounts and expanding the products and services sold to new and existing active accounts as a means of growing sales. Over time it became clear that the pursuit of smaller accounts consumed significant organizational energy and the large majority of new active accounts did not meaningfully increase in size. Further, the development of our web capabilities provided us with an alternative means of more efficiently servicing these smaller customers. Since 2020, our in-market locations have sought to shift our smallest customers to our web channel while shifting 10 their selling focus to 'key accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key account customers have typically been able to utilize a wider range of our products and services, and as a result have exhibited greater potential to increase in size while being more efficient to pursue and support. In 2023, we averaged 39,266 key accounts per month and approximately 92.4% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Active Accounts 105,448 119,583 130,020 137,380 152,491 156,069 156,464 Key Accounts 39,266 39,151 36,190 33,794 34,621 32,895 30,040 During 2023, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nDirect marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local in-market selling personnel, as well as our non-branch selling personnel. We support our sales team with multi-channel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing, print and radio advertising, targeted campaigns, promotional flyers, and events. In recent years, our national advertising has been focused on a NASCAR® sponsorship through our partnership with Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing® as the primary sponsor of the No. 17 car in the NASCAR® Cup Series, driven by Chris Buescher. In 2020, our sports marketing efforts were extended when the National Hockey League (NHL®) awarded us as the preferred MRO supplier of the sport.\nSeasonality Seasonality has some impact on our sales. The first and fourth quarters of each year are typically our lowest volume periods, given their overlap with winter months in North America during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. The fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the Thanksgiving (October in Canada and November in the United States), Christmas, and New Year holiday periods, due to plant shut downs. In contrast, the second and third quarters of each year typically have higher revenues due to stronger non-residential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays (although Good Friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of July will always fall in the third quarter).\nCompetition Our business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas, and smaller regional or local distributors, which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products, in no particular order, are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.\nMarket strategies in industrial distribution are varied. With respect to products, many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broad-line offering over time; however, they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share. This association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors, though many smaller competitors do deploy a broad-line model. Means of serving the customer are even more diverse. For instance, many competitors maintain a local, branch-based presence in their markets, while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses, while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales. Recent years have seen the emergence of eCommerce solutions, such as websites, and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors, it also has introduced non-traditional web-based competitors into the marketplace. The diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base. The large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels, from a single distributor or a range of distributors, to procure the products they need in their operations.\nWe believe that better service, and a competitive selling advantage, can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers' location(s). As a result, we maintain in-market locations in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products. The convenience of a large number of in-market locations in a given area, combined with our ability to provide them with frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers, facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our FMI solutions, supported by an in-market location, provide a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each in-market location also enhances our ability to compete (see 'Employees' below).\nOur Onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers. Building on our core business strategy of the local branch, the Onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers, all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure.\n11 Human Capital Resources Employees At the end of 2023, we employed 23,201 full- and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 71% held a selling role. We characterize these personnel as follows: 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total Selling personnel (1) 16,512 71.2% 15,898 71.0% Distribution/Transportation personnel 4,042 17.4% 3,974 17.8% Manufacturing personnel 733 3.2% 733 3.3% Organizational support personnel (2) 1,914 8.2% 1,781 8.0% Total personnel 23,201 100.0% 22,386 100.0% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nEmployee Profile As of December 31, 2023, we had 23,201 employees worldwide, with 18,539 of those employees located in the United States (U.S.), 3,038 employees located in Canada and Mexico, and 1,624 employees located overseas in 24 other countries throughout the world. Based on our EEO-1 data for 2023, in the U.S., females and minorities constitute 24.0% and 23.6% of our workforce, respectively. We believe these absolute figures gain further context when viewed against two additional data sets. First, over the past ten years there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business. Since 2013, our female and minority workforces have grown 2.2x and 3.8x faster, respectively, than our overall U.S. workforce. This trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution, including the natural progression of our geographic expansion, the cycle of our promote-from-within philosophy, and efforts to improve hiring processes over time. Second, based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we believe Fastenal's mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction, which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates. For instance, relative to the 24.0% of our U.S. workforce that is female, the proportion of females in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 29.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Similarly, relative to the 23.6% of our U.S. workforce that are minorities, the proportion of non-white (a definition utilized by the U.S. Census Bureau) individuals in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 21.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Health and Safety Employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a multi-faceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Today, our health and safety programs span all operations including manufacturing, distribution centers, fleet and auto, and our branch and Onsite network. These key business units play a dynamic role in defining how we engage with our employees on health and safety. Trainings, audits, inspections, risk assessments, safety coaching, and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility safety and employee safety. In 2023, there were over 214,000 completed health and safety engagements, which is an increase of 7% compared to 2022. Our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance. We continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows.\nThis commitment to, and continuous improvement toward, a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results. A widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the Experience Modification Rate (EMR). An organization's EMR is established through the comparison of a company's past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages, which are compiled by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization. Industry averages are benchmarked at a 1.00 EMR, with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization's ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols, resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk. In 2023, Fastenal had an EMR of 0.49, which is 51% better than the average performance rate for our industry.\n12 In 2023, we achieved third-party re-certification for the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This certification illustrates the strength of our health and safety programs, as well as our commitment to continual improvement to better support our growing workforce. As our business model continues to grow through our branch and Onsite network, our customer critical programs have evolved to mitigate risk and incidents, while meeting customer specific needs. This partnership with our customers allows us to collaborate and expand our health and safety programs to enhance our customers' workplace safety performance. Employment and Compensation Philosophy Fastenal's success is defined by our people. Our cultural values – Ambition, Integrity, Innovation, and Teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols, and inform our employment and compensation philosophies. Several principles underpin our employment philosophy. One principle is decentralization: placing employees close to our customers' operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service. A second principle is that we are a passionately promote-from-within company, guided by a belief that if you work hard, make great decisions, learn from mistakes, and exemplify our cultural values, you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility. We believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment. As it relates to our compensation philosophy, we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success, as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort. We are guided by simple principles. First, compensation programs should be easy to understand, with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided. They should be calculable by the employee and numbers-driven (e.g., not subjective). Second, total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers. Third, employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal.\nApproximately 71% of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis, with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customer-facing employees. Typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month, along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts, paid monthly, based on growth in sales, gross or pre-tax profit achieved, and prudent management of working capital. In certain roles, there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals, most of which are focused on either customer service or better execution of company-wide activities.\nBecause we believe the growth in the company's stock value should be the reward for achieving long-term success consistent with being an owner, we have a stock option plan. In the case of certain foreign employees, we have a stock appreciation rights plan. All of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights. We believe our combination of short- and long-term rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and levels of employee retention and turnover.\nOur employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.\nTalent Acquisition and Development Fastenal's values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons to stay include training, opportunity, and a welcoming environment. From a practical standpoint, this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities. In accordance with our decentralized leadership structure, we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening. In light of our promote-from-within philosophy, we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire.\nOur Human Resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage. We have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions, supplemented with training through the Fastenal School of Business (FSB). We have a Diversity and Compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework, which ensures its integrity. Not only is this process followed for all new hires, we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions.\n13 The FSB (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company-specific training and development programs that are offered to our employees. The programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructor-led training, virtual instructor-led training, and online learning. FSB provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees' performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning, as well as training plans based on roles within the company. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business, such as leadership, effective best practices, sales and marketing, products, supply chain, and distribution.\nProduct Sourcing Endeavors Sourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with all relevant regulations and applicable standards. Our teams conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us and require them to provide additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics, quality, and reliability. This ensures they meet our standards in these areas and are complying with Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing third-party tools and global databases, Fastenal actively monitors government sanctions, denied party listings, withhold release orders, export restriction updates, financial status, adverse media, and multiple other official exclusion lists that provide information on any known risk of any entities and locations with which Fastenal engages, and screens all business partners against those lists. Additionally, we monitor key areas of trade-related risk, including dual-use goods, trade cases, anti-dumping and counter-vailing cases, and other protectionist trade measures for all countries that products are traded in. As part of our comprehensive Supply Chain Security program, we also evaluate our suppliers' approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate, and appropriately compensated, employees and ensure upstream supply chain visibility on globally sourced products. With a local and global supplier base, continuous monitoring and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are triggered when risk may be evident, ensuring a safeguard against poor and/or impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation or ability to effectively operate in the marketplace. This is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding, but for the life of the relationship with the supplier. This process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of non-compliance or potential risk, we work with the supplier to correct the situation. If remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with Fastenal's standards and code of conduct, alternative sources of supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance, ensuring that no matter where a customers' operations may take them, Fastenal has the infrastructure, resources, and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations.\nIn 2023, approximately 29% of our total company-wide inventory spend was with small and/or diverse businesses. This flows from our Supplier Diversity program, as part of which we are committed to building supply chain relationships with small businesses and businesses with diverse ownership including women, minorities, veterans, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) owned Certified LGBT Business Enterprise® Suppliers. Available Information Our Internet address for corporate and investor information is www.fastenal.com. The information contained on our website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on or through our website at www.fastenal.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n14 ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows: Company-Specific Risks Operational Risks Products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, or death linked to the use of those products by our customers. Some of our customers operate in challenging industries in which there is a material risk of catastrophic events. We are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers, some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk. If any of these events are linked to the use of any of our products by our customers, claims could be brought against us by those customers, by governmental authorities, and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them, we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place, the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available, or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us. Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems, or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner, could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues, and result in less efficient operations. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner. Our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities. Still, information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, cybersecurity incidents, telecommunication failures, and other problems. In addition, certain software used by us is licensed from, and certain services related to our information systems are provided by, third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us. It is also possible that we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our information systems. Our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of company and customer data, as well as the success of our growth drivers, is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems. If critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable, if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations, or if certain insurance coverages are limited in their capabilities or affordability, it could adversely affect our profitability and/or ability to grow.\nThe ability to adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. Additionally, our business relies on the use, validity, and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which include current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements, as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect our rights. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to liability, require us to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost, or otherwise cause us to modify our operations.\nCyber security incidents, or violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace. The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain, and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent such unauthorized access, and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event, including any cyber security event. The development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Consequently, despite our efforts, the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. There 15 can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security were to occur, it could interrupt our operations, subject us to additional legal, regulatory, and operating costs, and damage our reputation in the marketplace. In addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data. New privacy security laws and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016, the California Consumer Protection Act, and other similar privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. Our ability to successfully attract, develop, and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs, sales at existing selling locations, and the successful execution of our growth drivers. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including inside and outside branch associates, Onsite managers, national account sales representatives, and logistical and administrative support personnel, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high, particularly for less tenured employees. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels.\nChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could continue to cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. Changes in our customer and product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline. For example, we have experienced a sustained increase in the proportion of our sales attributable to both non-fastener products and national accounts and Onsite customers. Non-fastener products typically have a lower gross profit percentage than fasteners because in many cases non-fastener products are less technical, have shorter supply chains, and are easier to transport. Similarly, national accounts and Onsite customers typically have a lower gross profit percentage than smaller customers by virtue of their scale, available business, and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross profit percentages. Whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are offset by positive impacts to gross profit percentage during such year. Setting aside the circumstances of any given year or period, however, customer and product mix have contributed to the decline of our gross profit percentage over time and, based on the anticipated sources of our future growth, will likely continue to reduce our gross profit percentage into the foreseeable future. There are other variables that could cause our gross profit percentage to decline, including downward pressure on sales prices due to deflation, increases in overseas freight charges, the inability of freight revenue to leverage the expenses associated with our captive trucking fleet, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition. We could experience reductions in the volume of purchases we make from our suppliers, which could reduce supplier volume allowances. We may not be able to pass higher product costs along to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. We experienced a number of these variables in 2023. A softer manufacturing economy caused relative weakness in our more cyclical and higher gross margin fastener product line versus our non-fastener product lines. Similarly, we continued to execute initiatives aimed at accelerating key account penetration, which resulted in relative growth in our lower gross margin national account and Onsite customers. The combination of these two events produced pressure on our product gross profit percentage in 2023 from product and customer mix.\nOur operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings. Over time, we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses, including costs related to payroll, occupancy, freight, and information technology, among others, as our net sales have grown. However, historically, a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales, allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins. There are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past. For instance, it is typical that when demand declines, most commonly from cyclical or general market factors (though it could be due to customer losses or some other company-specific event), our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales. It is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales. In addition, market variables, which include but are not exclusive of labor rates, energy costs, legal costs, and health care costs, could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses so as to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings. Should any of these scenarios, or a combination of them, occur in the future, it is possible that our operating and pre-tax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue.\n16 Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and/or financial reporting could materially impact our business and results. Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. Any system of internal controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all systems of internal controls, internal controls over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation, economic loss, or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur competitive advantage in FMI solutions, which includes industrial vending (FASTVend) and bin stock (FASTStock and FASTBin) tools could be eliminated and, in the case of FASTVend and FASTBin, the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices. Certain circumstances could lead to a short-term inability to promote and/or install our FMI solutions. We believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software, our local presence (allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly and with less burden on our customers), our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks, and, particularly in North America, our distribution strength. These advantages have developed over time; however, other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own. Such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business. In addition, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for our vending devices, RFID technology, and IR technology used in our FASTVend and FASTBin platforms. While devices, software, and services can be obtained from other sources, loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in our failure to meet short- or long-term goals related to the numbers of FASTVend and FASTBin devices we are able to deploy. Certain circumstances may reduce short-term customer receptivity to adopting our FMI services. For instance, during periods of dramatic change in economic activity, some customers may prioritize managing existing operations over adopting new technologies until business circumstances change.\nOur inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations. Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership. In the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future, the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight and/or leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal, talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles. In addition, difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team, or recruiting suitable replacements, could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations.\nFailure to implement an effective Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy could result in financial losses or impair our corporate reputation. Customers, suppliers, employees, community partners, shareholders, and regulatory agencies are increasingly scrutinizing our ESG disclosures and practices and factoring the social impact of our policies and practices into whether and how they engage with us. Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: • the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; • the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; • increases in reporting and operating regulations around ESG may result in higher operating expenses and/or capital expenditures that could reduce our profitability and/or cash flow; • the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability, diversity, and other ESG standards that we may set; • the availability of effective and acceptable emission offset technologies or strategies in the event such tools will be necessary to achieve overall emission reduction and mitigation goals; and • our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets.\nAn actual or perceived inability to satisfactorily address the concerns and disclosure expectations of our stakeholders could adversely affect our corporate reputation, image, identity, brand equity, and status, which could hurt our ability to retain and acquire customers and employees, lead to penalties for non-compliance, and/or negatively impact the price performance of our common stock.\n17 We may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business. Our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within North America and abroad. In recent years, we have increased the resources devoted to developing a multi-dimensional, differentiated service offering, including our Digital Footprint (which incorporates our FMI and e-procurement capabilities), Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, and process and consumption analytics. While we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business, we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth. Failure to achieve any of our goals regarding our Digital Footprint, Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, analytics, or other growth drivers could negatively impact our long-term sales and profit growth. In addition, failure to identify appropriate targets for the growth drivers of our business or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our internally developed and/or externally communicated deployment objectives.\nThe ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our selling efforts and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete, our ability to generate additional sales, and our profit margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at our selling locations and through our specialist roles and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers' needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our selling locations and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins.\nThe ability to adequately protect our reputation may have an adverse impact on operations and profitability. The Fastenal name is valuable to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on our ability to provide high quality products, deliver consistent services, and improve our customer's business operations. Further, information on our company, including our products and services, can be more easily accessed and more quickly disseminated through traditional and social media and digital channels. Should we fail to deliver a positive customer experience or should our public image be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based in fact, it could jeopardize our reputation and discourage customers from purchasing our products and services, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to grow our revenues and profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or non-traditional competitors, which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although slowly consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented, and highly competitive industry. Our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, technological, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources, technological advancements, and services. Increased competition from brick-and-mortar retailers could cause us to lose market share, reduce our prices, or increase our spending. Similarly, the emergence of online retailers, whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major, non-traditional competitors, could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods. These pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage over time.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies. Historically, the vast majority of our growth has been organic. However, we have completed several acquisitions over the last decade and expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including, among others, a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business, inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition, diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues, and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business, our industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions. Equity Risks Our stock price will fluctuate, and at times these fluctuations may be volatile. The prices of markets and individual equities tend to fluctuate. These fluctuations commonly reflect events, many of which may be fully or partially outside of our control, that may change investor's perception of our future earnings growth prospects, including changes in economic conditions, ability to execute business strategy, the impacts of public policy, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, and many other factors. While the sources of stock price fluctuation can be common across companies, the magnitude of these fluctuations can vary for different companies. This is commonly measured by beta, which is an individual stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. Our stock price has traditionally had a high beta value, which means fluctuations in the price of our shares will often be sharper than what is experienced by broader market indices. We can provide no assurance that the above-average historical volatility of our stock versus the broader market will moderate. Volatility in our stock price could also result in the 18 filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management's time, attention, and resources. There can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time. Stock prices, including ours, are commonly thought to be a function of earnings compounded by a multiple. This is often referred to as a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, although other forms of multiples are often utilized by investors to value our company's shares. Historically, investors have given our earnings a higher multiple, or premium, than is typical of the broader industrial sector with which we are typically associated. We believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth, profitability, and returns. However, to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies and/or poorly navigate the risks that surround our business, including those described throughout this section, or to the extent our industry (industrial distribution, or industrial stocks in general) loses favor in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program. Although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates. In addition, although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2022, 2020, and prior years through these programs, we may discontinue doing so at any time. Any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, to increase those dividends, or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations, the price of our common stock, credit conditions, and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nGeneral Economic and Operating Risks Operational Risks A downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. In general, our sales are the result of planned and unplanned customer spending on products used in production of final goods, infrastructure construction, and/or the maintenance of facilities. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others: • general business conditions; • business conditions in our principal markets; • changes in the value of local currencies relative to our functional currency, the United States dollar, • interest rates; • increases (inflation) or decreases (deflation) in the cost of products from our vendors, transportation services, energy and fuel prices, and electrical power rates; • liquidity in credit markets; • taxation; • government regulations and actions; • the impact on customer demand or availability of goods and services based on labor shortages or work stoppages; • unemployment trends; • terrorist attacks and acts of war; • impact of higher sustained global temperatures (global warming); • acts of God, which may include, but are not limited to, weather events, earthquakes, pandemics, etc.; and • other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.\nA downturn in either the national or local economies where we operate, or in the principal markets served by us, or changes in any of the other factors described above, could negatively impact sales at our in-market locations, sales through our other selling channels, and the level of profitability of those in-market locations and other selling channels. The primary variable affecting our results in 2023 was a softening in manufacturing sector business conditions.\nProducts manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available, which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results. We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, and other foreign countries. Our suppliers could discontinue or experience disruption in selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers' control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations, disruption in trade relationships and agreements, political unrest, war, disease, labor availability, or changes in local economic conditions. Additionally, the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial, capacity, or other difficulties. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is 19 unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing products and services of comparable quality and utility. Trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult and/or more costly, and could adversely impact our gross and/or operating profit percentage. We source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of North America, primarily Asia. We have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from Asia through our wholly-owned, Asia-based subsidiary, FASTCO Trading Co., Ltd. and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources. This was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production, but over time we have expanded our non-fastener sourcing as well, and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term. In light of this, changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations, our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers and/or impact the cost or price of our products, with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results. China represents a significant source of product for North America. In addition, we move and source products within North America. Any trading disruption (tariffs, product restrictions, etc.) between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business. There can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future, with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business. The degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies, their timing and duration, and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues.\nChanges in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales, cost of sales, gross profit percentage, distribution expenses, and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating income. Our suppliers can experience significant fluctuation over time in the cost of raw materials (e.g., steel, plastic, etc.) used to produce their products. They can also experience significant fluctuation in the cost of energy consumed in their production processes and in the cost of fuel consumed to transport their products. These suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. We also consume energy and fuel in our own operations, and can experience direct and significant fluctuation in our own costs. Increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit to decline, or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries, which could cause our sales to those customers to decline. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales. Given that we were founded and remain based in the United States and that we are publicly traded in the United States, we report our results based on the United States dollar. Because the functional currency related to most of our non-United States operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar as our Mexican activities are primarily conducted in United States dollars and our non-North American operations are relatively small in scale. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure. If we decide to do so in the future, we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect. We believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that North American market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed $140 billion. This figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreed-upon demand and market share statistics. Instead, we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources. If we have overestimated the size of our market, and in doing so, underestimated our current share of it, the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe. Similarly, we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies, such as FMI solutions and Onsite locations. Within North America, we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 1.7 million devices and we have identified over 12,000 customer locations with the potential to implement our Onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base. We have identified additional markets, such as government, healthcare, and academia, and geographies into which we can sell our FMI solutions, which would increase the number of identified potential FMI solutions or Onsite locations. However, our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies, which could extend the sales cycle. As is the case for total market size, we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources. These estimates are based on our business model today, and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies could cause them to change. In 20 addition, the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace (such as changes in customer concentration or needs), a change in the nature of that business strategy, or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or Onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity.\nThe industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share, gross profit, and operating income. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating, reflecting two factors. First, our customer's needs are evolving to reflect a greater awareness of the total cost and risk of fulfillment and their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations, including outside of North America. Second, providing these capabilities to our customers requires increasing investment in hardware, software, and analytic capabilities that require a certain degree of scale to support. While we believe that in a fragmented market such as exists for industrial supplies these emerging trends favor large distributors such as Fastenal, as the industry consolidates into fewer and larger competitors it may become more difficult to differentiate our product and service offering from that of our competitors. We also continue to see consolidation among our suppliers. This trend could result in fewer and larger suppliers, with greater channel power and negotiating leverage. There can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation within our industry or among our suppliers. In either or both cases, the trend toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our growth and/ or gross and operating profit. Furthermore, as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors, or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share.\nThe occurrence of a widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A public health crisis, if sufficiently widespread as to affect economic activity, could negatively impact our business. Mitigation efforts and prescriptions may be facilitated by regulatory authorities, which could limit our flexibility to pursue alternative, potentially more favorable, means of limiting these negative impacts. The effects on our business efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis may include a reduction in demand, inefficiencies due to workplace accommodations, reduced availability of personnel, supply chain disruption, or constraints on product availability, among other difficulties. In any such event, the severity, duration, and extent of the crisis can be difficult to predict, which can make it difficult to anticipate the magnitude and length of the impact on our sales, profits, and/or cash flow. It can also be difficult to anticipate what the effect on business conditions will be as the impacts of any public health crisis fades and mitigating policies are reversed. Inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks Our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, damage to our reputation, or the termination of contracts. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption laws, product compliance laws, environmental laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, advertising regulations, data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016, with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country) and cyber security requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products, labor and employment laws, and anti-competition regulations. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation, administration, and performance of our governmental contracts. We are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business. Ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business, and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts. 21 Tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results. We are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, and/or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed which contained tax-related provisions. We did not experience, and do not anticipate experiencing in the near future, any meaningful impact to our tax rates from the legislation. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and legal matters, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal control, and other changes that could increase our operating costs. We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from business transactions or the operation of our business. Due to the nature of our business, these proceedings may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, suits arising from our trucking operations, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor, intellectual property matters, or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results. As of December 31, 2023, we had $260.0 of outstanding debt obligations, all in the form of senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement). The notes issued under our Master Note Agreement carry a fixed interest rate and consist of five series and are described in further detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We also have borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) of $835.0, but no loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the rate on which may vary daily, and mature on September 28, 2027. We currently have the capacity under our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement to increase borrowings in the future to finance stock purchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital additions, acquisitions, or other investments. Should we seek to increase our borrowings during periods of volatility and disruption in the United States credit markets, financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain. This was not a material consideration in 2023. The cost of servicing any existing balances on our Credit Facility could increase if interest rates increase due to the SOFR-based interest rate provided for under our Credit Facility.\nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.\n22 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have established processes and procedures for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. These processes are in place to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Annual risk assessments are performed and incorporated as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) organizational process, which is overseen by our Board of Directors (the Board) and the Audit Committee, along with Executive Leadership. Our information security management system (ISMS) program is aligned to ISO 27001, which is an international standard to manage information security. ISO 27001 is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the world's largest developer of voluntary standards, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\nOur information technology (IT) security department, led by our Senior Vice President (SVP) IT Infrastructure & Security, is tasked with monitoring cybersecurity and operational risks related to information security and system disruption. The team employs measures designed to protect against, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats, and has implemented processes and procedures aligned with our information security management system to support and promote resilient programs. This includes: • Enterprise security framework and cyber security standards; • Cyber security awareness and training plans; • Security assessments and monitoring; • Restricted physical access to critical areas, servers, and network equipment; • Incident response, crisis management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans; and • Third-party IT vendor risk management process to identify, assess, and manage risks presented by our IT vendors and business partners.\nOur IT security department maintains a playbook to respond to potential cybersecurity threats. We conduct tabletop exercises for tactical response readiness, perform regular security scans of our environment both from an external and internal perspective, as well as work with a qualified third-party vendor to perform penetration tests of our environment. Any identified risks are included in our overall risk management program, and internal and external auditors validate our IT controls on a regular basis.\nWe conduct organization-wide cybersecurity training and compliance exercises in connection with our information security program. This training consists of educational material and compliance testing administered to all of our employees, which is tracked and recorded throughout the year. Results and progress are shared with Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board. Employee phishing tests are conducted on a regular basis. Employees who do not follow protocol are redirected for additional training. We have implemented an IT vendor risk management policy that provides guidance in managing risks associated with IT vendors and business partners. We have also established a third-party risk management program and conduct pre-onboarding security assessments and annual re-assessments of our service providers to collect, track, and manage third-party security controls based upon the risk presented to the business. Any issues identified during assessment are tracked through to remediation.\nGovernance Our Board of Directors and Audit Committee are actively engaged in the oversight of our risk management, including cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on information security from our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security. Additionally, Executive Leadership is briefed on information security at least quarterly by members of our IT security, compliance, governance, and audit teams. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing our risk exposure to information security, cybersecurity, and data protection, as well as the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our IT security department, which assesses and manages our risks from cybersecurity threats, is led by our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security, who reports to our Senior EVP IT. Additional oversight for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk include Executive sponsors, Information Technology, Human Resources, IT Governance Risk and Compliance, Internal Audit, and Legal, as well as members of our Information Security Risk Council, IT Risk Committee, and Enterprise Risk Management teams.\nWe have in place an incident response plan to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Information Security Risk Council, Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board are notified of any material cybersecurity incidents through an established escalation process. Additionally, we maintain a qualified third-party vendor relationship which is available to the team for on-demand incident response and investigation, as needed.\n23 The IT security department team members have degrees applicable to cybersecurity, including Bachelors in Information Systems, Computer Science, Management Information Systems and/or Masters in Cybersecurity, and hold professional certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Offensive Security Certified Professional, Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Defensible Security Architecture, GIAC Forensic Examiner, GIAC Incident Handling, and GIAC Open Source Intelligence. Our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security holds a Cybersecurity and Privacy Law Certificate from Mitchell Hamline School of Law, and has 28 years of experience in systems, network, and database administration. Additionally, our Senior IT security department manager is an Offensive Security Certified Professional, and holds GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC), with over 25 years of experience in network performance, availability, and protection.\nImpact of Cybersecurity Threats There have been no previous cybersecurity incidents which have materially affected us to date, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, any future potential risks from cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to exploitation of vulnerabilities, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain attacks, or other similar threats may materially affect us, including our execution of business strategy, reputation, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n24 ITEM 2.

(4) This facility contains an ASRS with capacity of 14,000 pallet locations, in addition to the 41,000 tote locations for small parts.\n(5) During 2021, we acquired land for future expansion of our distribution center in Magna, Utah, and, as of November 2023, earthwork is underway. This building is expected to be complete in June of 2025 and will be approximately 290,000 square feet.\n(6) In December 2018, we purchased an additional distribution center in High Point, North Carolina with approximately 750,000 total square feet. Approximately 395,000 square feet will be leased by the building's previous owner until December 2024. We currently utilize approximately 355,000 square feet for distribution activities.\n25 We also own, and in some cases, lease, the following support facilities, excluding selling locations: Location Purpose Leased Approximate Square Feet Winona, Minnesota Manufacturing facility 121,000 Indianapolis, Indiana Manufacturing facility 198,000 Houston, Texas Manufacturing facility 122,000 Wallingford, Connecticut Manufacturing facility 177,000 Rockford, Illinois Manufacturing facility 101,000 Johor, Malaysia Manufacturing facility 30,000 Brno-Lisen, Czech Republic Manufacturing facility X 20,000 Leeds, United Kingdom Manufacturing facility X 28,000 Winona, Minnesota Multiple facilities for office space, storage, and packaging operations 421,000 Bangalore, India International information technology office X 45,000 In addition, we own 154 buildings that house our in-market locations in various cities throughout North America.\nAll other buildings we occupy are leased. Leased branches range from approximately 3,000 to 20,000 square feet, with lease terms of up to 120 months (most initial lease terms are for 36 to 60 months).\nWe currently own land for future distribution center expansion and development. If economic conditions are suitable in the future, we will consider purchasing branch locations to house our older branches. It is anticipated the majority of new branch locations will continue to be leased. It is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular branch operations, when desirable. Our experience has been that there is sufficient space suitable for our needs and available for leasing.\nITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings, if any, is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.\n26 PART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Common Stock Data Dollar amounts in this section are stated in whole numbers.\nOur shares are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol 'FAST'.

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons for the current year and the prior year. Discussions of 2021 items can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Business and Operational Overview Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of more than 3,400 in-market locations. Our largest end market is manufacturing. Sales to these customers includes products for both original equipment manufacturing (OEM), where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers, and manufacturing, repair and operations (MRO), where our products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers. We also service general and commercial contractors in non-residential end markets as well as farmers, truckers, railroads, oil exploration companies, oil production and refinement companies, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our branches, Onsite locations, and customers are primarily located in North America, though we continue to grow our non-North American presence as well.\nIt is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace: First, it is big. We estimate the North American marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of $140 billion per year (and we have expanded beyond North America) and no company has a significant portion of this market. Second, many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive, but the cost and time to manage, procure, and transport these products can be quite meaningful. Third, many customers prefer to reduce their number of MRO and OEM suppliers to simplify their business, while also utilizing various technologies and models (including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly) to improve availability and reduce waste. Lastly, we believe the markets are efficient. In our view, this means that companies who grow market share are those that develop differentiated capabilities that provide the greatest value to the customer.\nOur approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto Growth Through Customer Service® and our tagline Where Industry Meets Innovation™. The concept of growth is simple: find more customers every day that value the services we provide and increase our activity with them. However, execution is hard work. First, we recruit service-minded individuals to support customers and empower them to operate in a decentralized fashion to maximize their flexibility to solve customer problems. We support these customer-facing resources with a supply chain capability that is speedy, efficient, and cost-effective. This has formed the foundation of our high-touch model since inception. Second, we invest in, develop, and deploy capabilities that allow us to illuminate and provide greater control over a customer's supply chain. These capabilities range from service models that take advantage of our local presence and/or our ability to more efficiently manage complex procurement needs, to hardware and software technologies that promote actionable data capture, improve operating efficiencies, and reduce supply chain risk. Third, we strive to generate strong profits, which produce the cash flow necessary to support our growth, our product and technology development, and the needs of our customers.\nThe ultimate aim of this 'high-touch, high-tech' approach to gaining market share is to allow us to get closer to our customers, going so far as to be right to the point of consumption within customers' facilities. Marrying our presence, capabilities and technologies deepens our relationships and our understanding of our customers' day-to-day opportunities and obstacles. This, in turn, enhances our ability to provide innovative and comprehensive solutions to our customers' challenges. By doing these things every day, Fastenal remains a growth-centric organization.\n29 Executive Overview The following table presents a performance summary of our results of operations for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 YOY Change 2021 YOY Change Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 5.2% $ 6,010.9 16.1% Business days 253 254 253 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 5.7% $ 23.8 15.7% Gross profit $ 3,354.5 3,215.8 4.3% $ 2,777.2 15.8% % of net sales 45.7% 46.1% 46.2% Operating and administrative expenses $ 1,825.8 1,762.2 3.6% $ 1,559.8 13.0% % of net sales 24.9% 25.2% 26.0% Operating income $ 1,528.7 1,453.6 5.2% $ 1,217.4 19.4% % of net sales 20.8% 20.8% 20.3% Earnings before income taxes $ 1,522.0 1,440.0 5.7% $ 1,207.8 19.2% % of net sales 20.7% 20.6% 20.1% Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 6.3% $ 925.0 17.5% Diluted net earnings per share $ 2.02 1.89 6.7% $ 1.60 17.8% Note – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the United States) in the period.\n2023 was a year of modest economic contraction in our key markets. The Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for the United States averaged 47.1 for the full year and remained below 50, the threshold demarcating manufacturing growth or contraction, every month. Industrial Production for the United States reflected moderating business activity, with markets that are most relevant to us, such as Fabricated Metals and Machinery, declining at an accelerating rate through the year. In addition, inflation in product costing flattened out, with some deflation emerging in fastener products. The combined effect of these dynamics was to produce daily sales growth in 2023 that slowed appreciably from 2022. We continued to migrate to a key accounts-focused model, expand our Onsite footprint, grow our installed base of FMI hardware, and lift the proportion of sales that run through our Digital Footprint. The efficiencies these investments provide and good organizational control of discretionary expenses allowed us to achieve a stable operating profit margin despite the challenges stemming from this slower and less inflationary environment. We also produced record operating cash flow which, combined with our confidence in the future cash generation capability of our business model, allowed us to pay a supplemental fifth dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full-time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our investments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of active Onsite locations), and weighted FMI devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period.\nQ4 2023 Q4 2022 Twelve-month % Change Selling personnel - absolute employee headcount 16,512 15,898 3.9 % Selling personnel - FTE employee headcount 15,070 14,476 4.1 % Total personnel - absolute employee headcount 23,201 22,386 3.6 % Total personnel - FTE employee headcount 20,721 19,854 4.4 % Number of branch locations 1,597 1,683 -5.1 % Number of active Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 12.3 % Number of in-market locations 3,419 3,306 3.4 % Weighted FMI devices (MEU installed count) 113,138 102,151 10.8 % 30 During the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 867. This reflects an increase in our total FTE selling personnel of 594 to support growth in the marketplace and sales initiatives targeting customer acquisition. We had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 124 to support increased product throughput at our facilities and to expand our local inventory fulfillment terminals (LIFTs). We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 149 that relates primarily to personnel investments in information technology, manufacturing, and operational support, such as purchasing and product development.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites activated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Branch openings 10 12 Branch closures, net of conversions (96) (122) Onsite activations 329 306 Onsite closures, net of conversions (130) (99) Our in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our in-market locations because of significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree international branches, which has more than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network. In any period, the number of locations closed tends to reflect normal churn in our business, whether due to redefining or exiting customer relationships, the shutting or relocation of customer facilities that host our locations, or a customer decision, as well as our ongoing review of underperforming locations. We will continue to open or close locations to sustain and improve our network, support our growth drivers, and manage our operating expenses. However, we believe the strategic rationalization that has produced the meaningful decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and we expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2023 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 45.7 % 46.1 % Operating and administrative expenses 24.9 % 25.2 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.8 % Net interest expense -0.1 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.7 % 20.6 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2023 2022 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 Percentage change 5.2% 16.1% Business days 253 254 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 Percentage change 5.7% 15.7% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.3% -0.5% The increase in net sales noted above for 2023 was due to higher unit sales of MRO, OEM, and construction supplies, as well as higher pricing as further set forth below.\n31 We believe higher unit sales in 2023 were primarily a result of our ability to gain market share, as most measures of industrial activity were flat to down throughout the period. Despite this challenging environment, in 2023 we produced net sales growth of 5.2% and, owing to one fewer selling day in the period, daily sales growth of 5.7%. Growth was led by our transportation customers, which includes sales to transportation services customers as the warehousing operations of retailer-oriented customers, and manufacturing end markets, which benefit disproportionately from our shift to a key account model. Our non-residential construction and reseller customers contracted during the period, which we believe is due to our shift to a key account model which tends to de-emphasize walk-in, over-the-counter, and infrequent transactions. Price contributed 160 to 190 basis points to our net sales growth in 2023. This contribution to growth from price was primarily due to easier comparisons in the first six months of 2023. For instance, in the first six months of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 240 to 270 basis points, while in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 110 to 140 basis points and 50 to 80 basis points, respectively. We increased total Onsite locations, the installed base of FMI devices, and our Digital Footprint in 2023, which enhanced the value we provide to our customers and supported our growth and efficiency. The rate of penetration we achieved with these growth drivers was uneven, however. We signed 326 Onsites in 2023, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 375 to 400 units and slightly below the prior year signings of 356 units. We signed 24,126 FMI MEUs, meeting our goal at the start of 2023 of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs and meaningfully above the prior year signings of 20,735 MEUs. We expanded the proportion of our sales running through our Digital Footprint to 56.1%, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 65.0% but above the prior year level of 49.3%. Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2023 2022 Fasteners 32.4% 34.0% Safety supplies 21.2% 20.8% Other product lines 46.4% 45.2% The shifts in product mix in 2023 compared to 2022 are largely attributable to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. Second, pricing for fasteners has decelerated at a faster pace than non-fastener products. These dynamics produced a meaningful divergence in the daily sales growth rates of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2023.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2023 11.2% 9.6% 6.8% 7.8% 5.2% 4.7% 3.7% 3.6% 5.0% 1.9% 3.8% 5.3% 2022 14.9% 21.3% 19.1% 20.3% 17.6% 16.0% 18.1% 16.1% 13.7% 13.6% 10.2% 8.0% 32 Sequential Trends We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.\nHistory has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days and/or seasons impact certain end markets, particularly non-residential construction. The first landing centers on Easter and the Good Friday holiday that precedes it, which in any given year can fall in March or April, the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our non-residential construction business and with the Christmas/New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.\nThe table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2023' and '2022' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '23Delta' and '22Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark. It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform. Jan.(1) Feb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative Change from Jan. to Oct.\nBenchmark (2) 0.2% 1.5% 3.8% -0.5% 2.7% 2.0% -3.1% 2.9% 3.6% -1.9% 11.2% 2023 -0.4% 1.7% 1.0% -0.2% 0.7% -0.2% -2.6% 1.3% 4.0% -3.0% 2.3% 23Delta -0.6% 0.1% -2.9% 0.2% -2.0% -2.1% 0.5% -1.6% 0.4% -1.1% -8.8% 2022 1.7% 3.1% 3.6% -1.2% 3.2% 0.2% -1.6% 1.3% 2.7% -0.1% 11.7% 22Delta 1.5% 1.6% -0.2% -0.7% 0.6% -1.7% 1.5% -1.6% -0.9% 1.8% 0.5% (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2) The benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month. As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\n33 A graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2023 2022 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 End Market Performance We estimate approximately 70% to 75% of our business is with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing, a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market. The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 14.4% 10.4% 6.2% 4.7% 8.9% 2022 23.9% 23.1% 22.6% 16.0% 21.3% We estimate approximately 25% to 30% of our business is with customers engaged in a wide range of activities, none of which individually constitute 10% of sales. This includes non-residential construction, reseller, transportation, and government customers. The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 -3.7% -5.3% -1.3% 0.9% -2.4% 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 34 Product Performance Our products fall into two functional subsets: (1) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts, which become part of a customer's finished good and (2) maintenance, repair, and operation (MRO), which maintain the facilities and equipment used by our customers.\nWhile certain products in our other product categories have an OEM application, such as welding consumables or metal cutting carbides, the majority of our sales for OEM applications are of fasteners. As a result, the best way to understand the change in our production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line (which represents 30% to 35% of our business). From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 7.0% 0.0% -2.0% -2.3% 0.7% 2022 24.6% 21.2% 18.2% 9.1% 18.1% By contrast, while we do sell significant quantities of MRO fasteners, the best way to understand the change in our MRO business is to examine the results in our non-fastener product lines, which include safety, tools, janitorial, and other products. From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 10.3% 9.2% 7.5% 6.6% 8.4% 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% Our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles, but because it is more dependent on whether a facility is operating than how much product that facility is producing, it does tend to exhibit less volatility in its growth than our fastener business. We also expect growth of our non-fastener products to outperform growth of our fastener products over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 45.7% 45.5% 45.9% 45.5% 45.7% 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.7% in 2023 and 46.1% in 2022. This decrease was primarily related to two factors. First, in 2023 customer and product mix had a negative effect on our gross profit percentage. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from larger customers, including Onsites, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we had higher organizational/overhead costs, including from higher inbound freight costs and working capital needs being relieved from inventory and generating higher period costs. These negative effects were partly offset by favorable freight costs, which reflects elevated domestic freight revenue leveraging what are relatively stable costs to support our captive fleet, lower expenses related to external freight providers, and lower fuel costs. Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 24.9% in 2023 from 25.2% in 2022. This primarily reflected improvement, as a percentage of net sales, in employee-related expenses as bonuses and commissions were down as a result of slower sales and profit growth in 2023 versus the prior year.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 3.4 % 14.7 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 4.2 % 2.6 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 4.2 % 18.5 % 35 Employee-related expenses include: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes.\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation. This was partly offset by a decline in bonuses reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Selling personnel (1) 4.1 % 7.9 % Distribution/Transportation personnel 4.2 % 8.4 % Manufacturing personnel 0.1 % 12.4 % Organizational support personnel (2) 8.6 % 9.5 % Total personnel 4.4 % 8.3 % (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOccupancy-related expenses include: (1) building rent and depreciation, (2) building utility costs, (3) equipment related to our branches and distribution locations, and (4) industrial vending equipment and bins utilized as part of FMI services (we consider this hardware to be a logical extension of our in-market operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses).\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: slightly higher depreciation and expenses related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents related to higher inflation and branch size.\nAll other operating and administrative expenses include: (1) selling-related transportation, (2) information technology (IT) expenses, (3) general corporate expenses, which consists of legal expenses, general insurance expenses, travel and marketing expenses, etc., and (4) sales of property and equipment.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: higher spending on information technology; higher general insurance costs; increased spending on travel and supplies; and higher bad debt expense. These elements were only partly offset by increased contributions from our supplier collaboration programs and increased income from asset sales related to our field truck fleet.\nNet Interest Our net interest expense was $6.7 in 2023 compared to $13.6 in 2022. We carried lower average debt balances in 2023 relative to the prior year, with cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. This was only partly offset by slightly higher average rates against borrowings under our Credit Facility due to changing interest rate levels in the marketplace. We also generated higher interest income in 2023 relative to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes. The decrease in our tax rate in 2023 is due primarily to an increase in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options.\n36 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 Basic EPS 2.02 1.89 Diluted EPS 2.02 1.89 Percentage Change 2023 2022 Net earnings 6.3 % 17.5 % Basic EPS 6.7 % 17.7 % Diluted EPS 6.7 % 17.8 % 2023 2022 Tax Rate 24.1 % 24.5 % During 2023, net earnings per share increased, primarily due to higher sales, lower net interest expense, a lower tax rate, and lower average fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of our buying back shares in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash provided $ 1,432.7 941.0 % of net earnings 124.0% 86.6% In 2023, we experienced an increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. The improvement in operating cash flow in 2023, as a percent of net earnings, reflects the reduced demand for working capital as a result of an improved supply chain and, to a lesser degree, slower business activity relative to the prior year.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2023 2023 2023 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,087.6 74.4 7.3% Inventories 1,522.7 (185.3) -10.8% Trade working capital $ 2,610.3 (110.9) -4.1% Accounts payable $ 264.1 9.2 3.6% Trade working capital, net $ 2,346.2 (120.1) -4.9% Net sales in last three months $ 1,758.6 63.0 3.7% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to three factors. First, our receivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due to relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. Third, and to a lesser degree, customers have historically delayed payments at the end of years that are economically challenged, and we saw that effect in 2023.\n37 Our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity, though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable. One reason for this is because it is cyclical. We source significant quantities of product from overseas, and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. As a result, trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions. A second reason relates to product cost and the length of our supply chain. A significant proportion of our products, particularly fasteners, are sourced from Asia and transported primarily by ship and rail to our North American network for sale. This requires us to purchase a meaningful quantity of our products months in advance of those products being available for sale in our North American facilities. Product that is in transit is in our inventory but is not available for sale, which can create a lag in our ability to adjust inventory levels or costs in response to rapid changes in economic or cost conditions. A third reason for increases in our inventory balances is our growth drivers, including our FMI offerings, Onsite channel, and international expansion, all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory.\nIn 2023, our inventories decreased, reflecting the absence of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. Our response at the time was to deepen our inventory as a means of maintaining high service to our customers, particularly for imported inventory. Dissipation of these disruptions has allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle. It is also likely that slower business activity reduced the level of inventory our customers required us to maintain to meet their production needs.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in accounts payable was primarily attributable to our product purchases increasing to support the growth in our business. The growth in our accounts payable balance is below the growth in our sales, which reflects the dissipation of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. This allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2023 2022 Selling locations 64% 58% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 36% 42% Total 100% 100% Lease Obligations We have facilities, equipment, and vehicles leased under operating leases. A discussion of our lease obligations is contained in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash used $ 161.2 163.0 % of net earnings 14.0% 15.0% Our net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was comparable to 2022 and primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures. Property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of: (1) purchases related to industrial vending, (2) purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers, (3) spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems, (4) the addition of fleet vehicles, (5) expansion, improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties, and (6) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, typically for the planned disposition of pick-up trucks as well as distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business, are netted against these purchases and additions.\n38 Set forth below is a recap of our 2023 and 2022 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2023 2022 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 83.9 97.8 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 24.0 21.5 Data processing software and equipment 33.4 30.6 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 7.0 12.4 Vehicles 24.5 11.5 Purchases of property and equipment 172.8 173.8 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (12.2) (11.4) Net capital expenditures 160.6 162.4 % of net sales 2.2% 2.3% % of net earnings 13.9% 14.9% Our net capital expenditures in 2023 were comparable to 2022, though they were below our original expectations for net capital investment during the year. The slower business environment in 2023 reduced the need to purchase certain equipment at the pace originally anticipated. We also saw the timing of certain outlays pushed out and, to a lesser extent, longer lead times on certain materials. It does not reflect the cancellation of any significant initiatives, and much of the spending is expected to occur in 2024 when we see our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, being in a range of $225.0 to $245.0. This increase reflects spending to complete our Utah distribution center, investments in picking technology and equipment in our hubs and branches, higher outlays for FMI hardware reflecting our higher targeted signings and a slight build in device inventory, and an increase in spending on information technology.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities The increase in net cash used in financing activities reflects higher dividend payments, including a supplemental payment in December of 2023, and a reduction in our outstanding debt obligations. These uses of cash were only partly offset by the absence of common stock purchases that we made in the prior year and, to a lesser degree, the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Cash dividends paid $ 1,016.8 711.3 % of net earnings 88.0% 65.4% Purchases of common stock — 237.8 % of net earnings —% 21.9% Total returned to shareholders $ 1,016.8 949.1 % of net earnings 88.0% 87.3% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (30.1) (9.2) % of net earnings -2.6% -0.8% Debt obligations payments (proceeds), net $ 295.0 (165.0) % of net earnings 25.5% -15.2% Net cash used $ 1,281.7 774.9 % of net earnings 111.0% 71.3% Stock Purchases In 2023, we did not purchase any of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\n39 Dividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on January 17, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78. This included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023 reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24.\nDebt In order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business, expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers, pay dividends, we have borrowed under our Credit Facility and our Master Note Agreement in recent periods.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2023 as follows: Peak borrowings 2023 First quarter $ 565.0 Second quarter 470.0 Third quarter 350.0 Fourth quarter 330.0 As of December 31, 2023, we had $0.0 outstanding under the Credit Facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount of $32.7. As of December 31, 2023, we had loans outstanding under the Master Note Agreement of $260.0. Descriptions of our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, debt, and lease obligations, each of which are discussed in more detail earlier in this section. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions but we do not believe any of these liabilities will be material. A discussion of income taxes is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnremitted Foreign Earnings Approximately $213.2 of cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries on December 31, 2023. These funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash. We have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the U.S., even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Inflation In 2023, we observed easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping) resulting in stable costs for most of our product offering. As a result, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2023 and we saw our contribution to growth in daily sales due to price moderate throughout the year. The exception to this stability was cost deflation for imported goods, which resulted in modest price deflation specifically in our fastener product line over the course of the year. The net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2023.\n40 PRIOR YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2022 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2022 2021 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 46.1 % 46.2 % Operating and administrative expenses 25.2 % 26.0 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.3 % Net interest expense -0.2 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.6 % 20.1 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2022 2021 Net sales $ 6,980.6 6,010.9 Percentage change 16.1% 6.4% Business days 254 253 Daily sales $ 27.5 23.8 Percentage change 15.7% 7.3% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.5% 0.6% The increase in net sales noted above for 2022 was due to higher unit sales of MRO and OEM supplies to traditional manufacturing and construction customers and higher pricing as further set forth below.\nHigher unit sales in 2022 were a result of healthy economic activity throughout the period, though we did observe some moderation in demand as the year progressed. This moderation in demand, combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed, produced daily sales growth of 18.1% in the first half of 2022, daily sales growth of 13.3% in the second half of 2022, and daily sales growth of 8.0% in December 2022. Growth was led by our manufacturing customers, with particular strength in markets involved with commodity and capital goods production. Our non-residential construction customers grew on an annual basis, but turned slightly negative in the fourth quarter. We believe the relative underperformance of this customer category reflects deliberate shifts in our branch strategy that de-emphasized walk-in and over-the-counter transactions. We also experienced a normalization in other aspects of the operating environment in 2022, specifically the dissipation or moderation over the course of the year of product and transportation inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor market constraints. This affected two aspects of our growth during the period.\nFirst, price contributed 540 to 570 basis points to our net sales growth in 2022. However, as inflationary pressures eased and product availability improved, the need for aggressive pricing actions declined. The absence of such actions combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed resulted in the contribution from price to net sales growth moderating, from averaging 620 to 650 basis points in the first half of 2022, to averaging 450 to 480 basis points in the second half of 2022 and to averaging 350 to 380 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nSecond, as inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints became more predictable and manageable and then largely dissipated, it allowed our customers to shift from short-term business management to long-term strategic planning. This, in turn, provided us more opportunities to engage with customers over our key growth drivers, including Onsite and FMI. As a result, while we did not reach the signings goals we had set out at the start of the year, we saw a meaningful increase in signings in 2022 over the prior year, and a return to near pre-pandemic levels. We signed 356 Onsites in 2022, below our goal of 375 to 400 units but above the prior year (274 signings). Similarly, we signed 20,735 FMI MEUs, below our goal of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs but above the prior year (19,311 MEUs).\n41 Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2022 2021 Fasteners 34.0% 33.3% Safety supplies 20.8% 21.2% Other product lines 45.2% 45.5% The shifts in product mix in 2022 compared to 2021 largely reflect the reversal of pandemic-related activity combined with the relative growth of our more cyclical fastener line as growth in manufacturing and construction end markets accelerated as the post-pandemic North American economy recovered.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2022 14.9 % 21.3 % 19.1 % 20.3 % 17.6 % 16.0 % 18.1 % 16.1 % 13.7 % 13.6 % 10.2 % 8.0 % 2021 6.5 % 1.5 % 7.5 % 1.2 % -3.2 % 1.7 % 9.7 % 9.0 % 11.1 % 14.1 % 13.2 % 16.5 % Sequential Trends The table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2022' and '2021' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '22Delta' and '21Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark.\n42 It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform.\nJan. (1) Feb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative Change from Jan. to Oct.\nBenchmark (2) -0.1% 0.8% 3.4% 0.1% 2.2% 1.9% -3.3% 3.1% 3.4% -2.1% 9.5% 2022 1.7% 3.1% 3.6% -1.2% 3.2% 0.2% -1.6% 1.3% 2.7% -0.1% 11.7% 22Delta 1.7% 2.4% 0.2% -1.3% 1.1% -1.7% 1.6% -1.8% -0.7% 2.0% 2.2% 2021 0.9% -2.3% 5.6% -2.2% 5.6% 1.6% -3.4% 3.1% 4.8% 0.0% 13.0% 21Delta 1.0% -3.0% 2.2% -2.3% 3.4% -0.3% -0.2% 0.0% 1.5% 2.1% 3.5% (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2) The benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month. As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nA graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2022 2021 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 43 End Market Performance The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 23.9 % 23.1 % 22.6 % 16.0 % 21.3 % 2021 5.6 % 24.5 % 20.8 % 23.8 % 18.4 % The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 2021 4.9% -30.7% -8.2% -2.3% -11.3% Product Performance From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 24.6 % 21.2 % 18.2 % 9.1 % 18.1 % 2021 4.0 % 28.4 % 20.2 % 24.2 % 18.8 % From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% 2021 6.1% -10.8% 5.1% 9.6% 1.9% Two product lines, safety and janitorial, accounted for approximately 44% of total non-fastener sales in 2022. The pattern in 2021, and particularly the second quarter of 2021, was affected by difficult comparisons versus the prior year, when the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge of safety and janitorial supplies that was not repeated to the same degree in 2022. Setting aside the unique circumstances surrounding the pandemic, our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles. However, we would typically expect it to outperform our fastener business over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% 2021 45.4% 46.5% 46.3% 46.5% 46.2% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.1% in 2022 and 46.2% in 2021, a decrease of 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily related to three factors. First, in 2022 we experienced relatively higher growth from our large and Onsite customers, which tend to have a lower gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. This was only partly offset by favorable product mix resulting from relatively higher growth from our fasteners products during the year, which tend to have a higher gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. Second, in the second half of 2022, we did not pass through pricing sufficient to offset higher costs, which resulted in an adverse impact on our gross margin percentage. Third, in the second half of 2022, we experienced lower product margins for certain categories of our other products. We believe slower demand and greater product availability in the marketplace due to supply chain normalization has put some pressure on products that tend to be sold less frequently by our business units. These factors were mostly offset by a reduction in the amount of pandemic-related write-downs and narrower losses to operate our truck fleet related to our strong freight revenue growth leveraging relatively stable fleet costs.\n44 Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.2% in 2022 from 26.0% in 2021. This reflected a decline, as a percentage of net sales, in employee- and occupancy-related expenses.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 14.7 % 11.6 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 2.6 % 3.9 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 18.5 % 4.9 % Our employee-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher base pay and employment taxes from higher FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation; an increase in bonuses and commissions resulting from improved sales and profitability; and an increase in our profit sharing contribution. This was partly offset by a decline in health insurance costs, as the use of medical services by employees normalized following the post-pandemic catch-up activity in 2021. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Selling personnel (1) 7.9% 1.7% Distribution/Transportation personnel 8.4% 5.8% Manufacturing personnel 12.4% 2.0% Organizational support personnel (2) 9.5% 7.4% Total personnel 8.3% 2.8% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; slightly higher depreciation related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; and slightly higher facility costs, with higher utility costs being only partly offset by lower rents stemming from branch consolidations.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs related to selling-related transportation, including higher fuel costs; higher spending on information technology; higher spending on travel, meals, and supplies; and higher general insurance expense. These elements were only partly offset by lower bad debt expense.\nNet Interest Expense Our net interest expense was $13.6 in 2022 compared to $9.6 in 2021. We carried higher average debt balances in 2022 relative to the prior year, and specifically higher balances of variable rate credit facility debt, as a result of high sustained working capital needs and an increase in share buybacks. We also incurred higher average interest rates during the year due to changes in interest levels in the marketplace.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $282.8 in 2021, or 23.4% of earnings before income taxes. The increase in our tax rate in 2022 is due primarily to reduced benefits associated with the exercise of stock options, an increase in state income tax expense, and an absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited 2021.\n45 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 1,086.9 925.0 Basic EPS 1.89 1.61 Diluted EPS 1.89 1.60 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Net earnings 17.5 % 7.7 % Basic EPS 17.7 % 7.5 % Diluted EPS 17.8 % 7.4 % 2022 2021 Tax Rate 24.5 % 23.4 % During 2022, net earnings increased, primarily due to higher sales and our ability in the period to grow costs more slowly than we grew sales. This was only slightly offset by a higher income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash provided $ 941.0 770.1 % of net earnings 86.6% 83.3% In 2022, we experienced a slight increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, though this reflects a significant increase in our conversion percentage in the second half of 2022 which more than offset a significant decline in our conversion percentage in the first half of 2022. Taken as a whole, while our working capital needs remained elevated through 2022, they declined slightly on a year-over-year basis whereas our earnings increased on a year-over-year basis.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2022 2022 2022 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,013.2 113.0 12.6% Inventories 1,708.0 184.4 12.1% Trade working capital $ 2,721.2 297.4 12.3% Accounts payable $ 255.0 21.9 9.4% Trade working capital, net $ 2,466.2 275.5 12.6% Net sales in last three months $ 1,695.6 969.8 16.1% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2022, the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflected several factors. First, our receivables are expanding due to improved business activity and resulting growth in our customers' sales. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our customer mix due to relatively stronger sales growth from national account customers, which tend to be larger and carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. 46 In 2022, our inventories increased, reflecting significant inflation in the value of stocked parts, the addition of inventory to support the growth of our manufacturing and construction customers as they expand production to meet improved business activity, deeper inventory stocking due to disruption in supply chains, and our efforts to sustain higher internal fulfillment rates. In 2022, the annual growth in accounts payable reflected product purchases increasing to support the improvement in business activity at our manufacturing and construction customers.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2022 2021 Selling locations 58% 57% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 42% 43% Total 100% 100% Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash used $ 163.0 148.5 % of net earnings 15.0% 16.1% The changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was primarily related to higher net capital expenditures. Set forth below is a recap of our 2022 and 2021 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2022 2021 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 97.8 70.3 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 21.5 11.0 Data processing software and equipment 30.6 28.0 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 12.4 37.9 Vehicles 11.5 9.4 Purchases of property and equipment 173.8 156.6 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (11.4) (8.4) Net capital expenditures 162.4 148.2 % of net sales 2.3% 2.5% % of net earnings 14.9% 16.0% Our net capital expenditures increased in 2022, when compared to 2021. The most significant area driving this increase was higher spending on FMI equipment. We had slightly higher property spending, which reflected significant investments in automation and upgrades at our hubs mostly offset by lower spending on a new building in downtown Winona, which was completed in 2021. We had only modest increases related to our vehicle fleet, manufacturing operations, and information technology. Net capital expenditures in 2022 were below our anticipated range of $170.0 to $190.0 due to certain equipment and project delays related to hub projects.\n47 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities were due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases. These amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments (proceeds) from debt obligations. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Cash dividends paid $ 711.3 643.7 % of net earnings 65.4% 69.6% Purchases of common stock 237.8 — % of net earnings 21.9% —% Total returned to shareholders $ 949.1 643.7 % of net earnings 87.3% 69.6% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (9.2) (31.6) % of net earnings -0.8% -3.4% Debt obligations (proceeds) payments, net $ (165.0) 15.0 % of net earnings -15.2% 1.6% Net cash used $ 774.9 627.1 % of net earnings 71.3% 67.8% Stock Purchases In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share. In 2021, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe had authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization did not have an expiration date.\nDividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on January 18, 2023. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24. In 2021, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.12.\nDebt Our borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2022 as follows: Peak borrowings 2022 First quarter $ 525.0 Second quarter 595.0 Third quarter 650.0 Fourth quarter 710.0 Effects of Inflation In 2022, we began to observe easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping). However, this did not translate into a reduction in inflationary pressures on our financial results for two reasons. First, inflationary pressures accelerated through 2021, and many periods in 2022 were comparing to lower cost levels in the preceding year. Second, we have a long supply chain for many products, and it can take several quarters from when inflationary pressures begin to recede for the effect to impact our earnings results. In 2022, we increased prices, sought alternative sources for products and services, and consolidated spend for products and services as a means of mitigating inflation. However, higher product and transportation costs did have a slightly negative effect on our gross margin percentage for the full year. 48 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Inventories, are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following: Allowance for Credit Losses – This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nInventory valuation – Adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels, sales information, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory, or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nGeneral insurance reserves – These reserves are for general claims related to workers' compensation, property and casualty losses, and other general liability self-insured losses. The reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends. We perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels. We analyze historical trends, claims experience, and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, if any, is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity steel pricing, commodity energy prices, and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows: Import shipping costs – We import a significant quantity of our products, particularly fasteners and private label products, from foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. As a result, we incur costs related to shipping charges, duties, harbor fees, and sundry other expenses involved in the movement of product for sale in North America and our other global locations. These costs are embedded in our product values, and significant fluctuations can affect our product gross profit depending on what mitigating actions might be taken. The most significant contributor to these fluctuations is the cost of overseas shipping containers. During 2023, the cost of overseas shipping containers was below the prior year. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to import shipping costs was $23.0 to $28.0 in 2023. Commodity steel prices – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. During 2023, the price of steel as reflected in many market indexes has been below prior year levels, though in most cases price levels have stabilized in recent periods and the rate of decline is moderating. Due to our long supply chain, changes in the cost of steel can take a number of quarters to be reflected in our financial results. Further, the cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the steel products that we sell, which can also diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity steel prices was immaterial in 2023.\nCommodity energy prices – We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity. As reflected in many market indexes, energy prices during 2023 were generally below prior year levels, which contributed to lower costs for fuel consumed in our vehicles and lower utility costs at our facilities. Total direct fuel consumption is a relatively minor cost to the company and, as a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity energy prices was immaterial in 2023. Fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell. During 2023, prices for fossil fuels were generally below prior year levels. The cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the products that we sell, which can diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. As a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to materials for which fossil fuels are a feedstock was immaterial in 2023.\nForeign currency exchange rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments, our operations in countries other than the U.S., and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material. We estimate the effect on our sales and net earnings related to changes in foreign exchange rates was $18.7 and immaterial, respectively, in 2023.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates. As a result, changes in such rates can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage point increase to our floating rate debt in 2023 would have resulted in approximately $0.6 of additional interest expense. A description of our Credit Facility is contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 ITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Fastenal Company: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fastenal Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II — valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n51 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of audit evidence over inventory quantities at in-market locations As disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet, the Company held $1,522.7 million of inventory, the majority of which was held at 3,419 in-market locations, as of December 31, 2023. The Company's processes to track and determine consolidated inventory relies on a perpetual inventory system which involves the interaction of information technology (IT) systems.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the quantities of inventory at in-market locations as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over quantities of inventory at in-market locations required challenging auditor judgment to assess the number of in-market locations visited and included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge due to the interaction of IT systems that track physical inventory quantities by location.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included IT application controls, as well as certain controls related to access to programs and data, program changes, and computer operations. It also included certain controls related to the Company's physical inventory cycle counts. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing certain IT controls, inclusive of the interface of IT systems, which support the Company's perpetual inventory system. We applied auditor judgment in the determination of the locations to test the Company's inventory quantities by evaluating: • Homogeneity of the locations; • Historical inventory locations we have visited and results of prior physical counts; • Inventory dollars by location; and • The Company's inventory cycle count results, including the results of monitoring and compliance with cycle count program by in-market location.\nWe tested the existence and completeness of inventory by counting inventory quantities on a sample basis through in-market location visits during the year to evaluate the Company's perpetual inventory records. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over the quantities of inventory at in-market locations.\n/s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.

Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Overview Fastenal is a leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of branches and Onsite locations. Collectively, we refer to our branches and Onsite locations as in-market locations. We have more than 3,400 in-market locations located primarily in North America.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fastenal Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, referred to as Fastenal or by terms such as we, our, or us). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns and any related sales incentives. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when or as we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by transferring control of the promised products to the customer, with the majority of revenue recognized at the point in time the customer obtains control of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Using probability assessments, which are based on known inputs at year-end, we estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the contract. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation and are short term in nature. Sales taxes and value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.\nAccounts Receivable Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions The functional currency of our foreign operations is typically the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into United States dollars for balance sheet accounts, except retained earnings, using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, for retained earnings at historical exchange rates, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the applicable period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders' equity captioned accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in cost of sales or operating and administrative expenses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories Inventories, consisting of finished goods merchandise held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value. We record valuation adjustments for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory that are equal to the difference between the cost and estimated net realizable value for that inventory. These estimates are based on a review and comparison of the current inventory levels to projected and historical sales of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided for using the straight-line method over the anticipated economic useful lives of the related property.\nLeases We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, the current portion of operating lease liabilities, and the operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 The ROU assets represent our right to control the use of an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent, taxes, and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area or other maintenance costs) which are accounted for as a single lease component as we have elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components for all leases. Our pick-up truck leases typically have a non-cancelable lease term of less than one year and therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to exclude these short-term leases from our ROU assets and lease liabilities. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at our sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. We regularly evaluate the renewal options and when they are reasonably certain of exercise, we include the renewal period in our lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. We have a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment, we apply a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid deposits, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets, and are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as necessary. There were no impairments recorded during any of the three years reported in these consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nInsurance Reserves We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, health, and general liability costs. Specific stop-loss coverage is provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Self-insurance liabilities are based on our estimate of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nProduct Warranties We offer a basic limited warranty for certain of our products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. We typically recoup these costs through product warranties we hold with the original equipment manufacturers. Our warranty expense has historically been minimal.\nStock-Based Compensation We estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in operating and administrative expenses. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 59 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options considered to be 'in-the-money' (i.e., when the market price of our stock is greater than the exercise price of our outstanding stock options).\nSegment Reporting We have determined that for our North American regions we meet the aggregation criteria outlined in the accounting standards as these regions have similar: (1) economic characteristics, (2) products and services, (3) customers, (4) distribution channels, and (5) regulatory environments. Considering our operations outside of North America represent less than 10% of our net sales, net earnings, or assets, we report as a single business segment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reporting requirements under Topic 280. The enhanced disclosure requirements include: title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), significant segment expenses provided to the CODM, extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarifying single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, and permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain circumstances. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply retrospectively to all periods presented.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. The new guidance requires consistent categorization and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as further disaggregation of income taxes paid. This change is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply on a prospective basis to annual financial statements for periods beginning after the effective date. However, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 60 Note 2. Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue The accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Stockholders' Equity Dividends On January 17, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share of common stock to be paid in cash on February 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.78, which included a special, one-time dividend of $0.38 per share. We paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.24 and $1.12 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Options Effective January 2, 2024, the compensation committee of our board of directors granted to our employees options to purchase a total of 764,195 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. On the same date, certain of our non-employee directors received options to acquire a total of 50,717 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. The closing stock price on the effective date of the grants was $63.55 per share.\nThe following tables summarize the details of options granted under our stock option plans that were still outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and the assumptions used to value those grants. All such grants were effective at the close of business on the date of grant.\nOptions Granted Option Exercise Price Closing Stock Price on Date of Grant December 31, 2023 Date of Grant Options Outstanding Options Exercisable January 3, 2023 1,071,943 $ 48.00 $ 47.400 989,048 70,562 January 3, 2022 713,438 $ 62.00 $ 61.980 611,848 53,355 January 4, 2021 741,510 $ 48.00 $ 47.650 591,206 211,323 January 2, 2020 902,263 $ 38.00 $ 37.230 658,884 322,242 January 2, 2019 1,316,924 $ 26.00 $ 25.705 758,611 451,061 January 2, 2018 1,087,936 $ 27.50 $ 27.270 541,026 419,460 January 3, 2017 1,529,578 $ 23.50 $ 23.475 523,828 426,290 April 19, 2016 1,690,880 $ 23.00 $ 22.870 245,075 188,177 April 21, 2015 1,786,440 $ 21.00 $ 20.630 54,552 54,552 Total 10,840,912 4,974,078 2,197,022 Date of Grant Risk-free Interest Rate Expected Life of Option in Years Expected Dividend Yield Expected Stock Volatility Estimated Fair Value of Stock Option January 3, 2023 4.0% 5.00 2.6% 29.58% $ 11.62 January 3, 2022 1.3% 5.00 1.7% 28.52% $ 13.68 January 4, 2021 0.4% 5.00 2.0% 29.17% $ 9.57 January 2, 2020 1.7% 5.00 2.4% 25.70% $ 6.81 January 2, 2019 2.5% 5.00 2.9% 23.96% $ 4.40 January 2, 2018 2.2% 5.00 2.3% 23.45% $ 5.02 January 3, 2017 1.9% 5.00 2.6% 24.49% $ 4.20 April 19, 2016 1.3% 5.00 2.6% 26.34% $ 4.09 April 21, 2015 1.3% 5.00 2.7% 26.84% $ 3.68 All of the options in the tables above vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years. Generally, each option will terminate approximately 10 years after the grant date.\nThe fair value of each share-based option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the assumptions listed above. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the time of grant. The expected life is the average length of time over which we expect the employee groups will exercise their options, net of forfeitures, which is based on historical experience with similar grants. The dividend yield is estimated over the expected life of the option based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends. Expected stock volatilities are based on the movement of our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 63 A summary of activities under our stock option plans consisted of the following: Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2023 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Granted 1,071,943 $ 48.00 9.00 Exercised (1,170,693) $ 25.69 Cancelled/forfeited (301,908) $ 45.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 4,974,078 $ 38.70 5.99 Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 2,197,022 $ 30.88 4.54 Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2022 5,173,270 $ 30.23 6.08 Granted 713,438 $ 62.00 9.00 Exercised (346,992) $ 26.78 Cancelled/forfeited (164,980) $ 40.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 2,437,636 $ 27.14 4.30 (1) Weighted average exercise price.\n(2) Weighted average remaining contractual life in years.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $38.1, $10.2, and $38.8, respectively. The intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the underlying shares at the date of exercise. At December 31, 2023, there was $16.6 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options granted under the employee stock option plan. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.18 years. Any future change in estimated forfeitures will impact this amount. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested under our employee stock option plan during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $5.3, $5.2, and $4.8, respectively.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option plan was $7.3, $7.2, and $5.6 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nShares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year 570,811,674 575,464,682 574,159,575 Stock options exercised 1,170,693 346,992 1,305,107 Purchases of common stock — (5,000,000) — Balance at end of year 571,982,367 570,811,674 575,464,682 Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 64 Earnings Per Share The following tables present a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share and a summary of the options to purchase shares of common stock which were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive: Reconciliation 2023 2022 2021 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 571,271,846 573,777,790 574,808,030 Weighted shares assumed upon exercise of stock options 1,736,762 1,845,324 2,309,026 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 573,008,608 575,623,114 577,117,056 Summary of Anti-dilutive Options Excluded 2023 2022 2021 Options to purchase shares of common stock 1,568,460 1,335,898 678,310 Weighted average exercise prices of options $ 53.80 55.25 48.00 Any dilutive impact summarized above related to periods when the average market price of our stock exceeded the exercise price of the potentially dilutive stock options then outstanding.\nNote 6. Retirement Savings Plan The Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan covers all of our employees in the United States. Our employees in Canada may participate in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The general purpose of both of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings contributions. In addition to the participation of our employees, we make annual profit sharing contributions based on an established formula. The expense recorded under this profit sharing formula was approximately $23.1, $22.1, and $17.4 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Note 7.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $9.2 as of December 31, 2023 and $8.6 as of December 31, 2022. We believe it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $1.4 in unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2024 as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations. The 2023 and 2022 liability is included in deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, all states, and various local and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before 2020 in the case of United States federal examinations, and with limited exception, before 2018 in the case of foreign, state, and local examinations.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of our approximately $514.7 of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 66 Note 8. Operating Leases We lease space under non-cancelable operating leases for several distribution centers, several manufacturing locations, and certain branch locations. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. We also lease certain semi-tractors, pick-up trucks, and computer equipment under operating leases. Certain operating leases for pick-up trucks contain residual value guarantee provisions which would generally become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. The aggregate residual value guarantee related to these leases was approximately $118.4. We believe the likelihood of funding the guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease agreements is remote. The cost components of our operating leases were as follows for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Operating lease cost $ 99.4 18.2 117.6 96.8 14.7 111.5 99.7 13.7 113.4 Variable lease cost 10.5 1.6 12.1 9.7 1.5 11.2 10.4 1.3 11.7 Short-term lease cost — 23.7 23.7 — 26.6 26.6 — 19.2 19.2 Total $ 109.9 43.5 153.4 106.5 42.8 149.3 110.1 34.2 144.3 Variable lease costs are excluded from ROU assets and lease liabilities and consist primarily of taxes, insurance, and common area or other maintenance costs for our leased facilities and equipment which are paid based on actual costs incurred by the lessor as well as variable mileage costs related to our leased vehicles.\nMaturities of our lease liabilities for all operating leases were as follows as of December 31, 2023: Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total 2024 $ 86.1 14.2 100.3 2025 65.1 12.1 77.2 2026 43.3 8.9 52.2 2027 26.5 5.1 31.6 2028 14.7 3.1 17.8 2029 and thereafter 13.0 1.5 14.5 Total lease payments $ 248.7 44.9 293.6 Less: Imputed interest (15.2) (3.4) (18.6) Present value of lease liabilities $ 233.5 41.5 275.0 The weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for all of our operating leases were as follows for the periods ended December 31: Remaining lease term and discount rate: 2023 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) Leased facilities and equipment 3.76 3.57 Leased vehicles 3.77 2.66 Weighted average discount rate Lease facilities and equipment 3.07% 2.07% Leased vehicles 4.03% 2.47% Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 67 Supplemental cash flow information related to our operating leases was as follows for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash outflow from operating leases $ 115.7 110.9 112.4 Leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 116.2 89.4 103.6 Note 9.

The Credit Facility includes a committed letter of credit subfacility of $55.0. Any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility for which we have the ability and intent to pay using cash within the next 12 months will be classified as a current liability. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants, and our right to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our compliance with these covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus a 0.10% spread adjustment plus 0.95%. We pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Credit Facility. This fee is either 0.10% or 0.125% per annum based on our usage of the Credit Facility.\nSenior Unsecured Promissory Notes Payable We have issued senior unsecured promissory notes under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement) in the aggregate principal amount of $260.0 as of December 31, 2023. Our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Master Note Agreement is $900.0; however, none of the institutional investors party to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder. There is no amortization of these notes prior to their maturity date and interest is payable quarterly. The notes currently issued under our Master Note Agreement, including the maturity date and fixed interest rate per annum of each series of note, are contained in the table above. The Master Note Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants and we are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 68 Principal payments required on our outstanding indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within our long-term debt arrangements, for the succeeding five years, are displayed in the table below, as of December 31, 2023: Principal Payments 2024 $ 60.0 2025 75.0 2026 25.0 2027 50.0 2028 — 2029 and thereafter 50.0 Total $ 260.0 Note 10. Legal Contingencies We are involved in certain legal actions, including those that are ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. We record a liability for these legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. As of December 31, 2023, there were no litigation matters that we consider to be probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse outcome.\nNote 11. Subsequent Events We evaluated all subsequent event activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of the dividend declaration and stock option activities disclosed in Note 5.\n***End of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements*** Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 69 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Securities Exchange Act)). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The attestation report required under Item 9A is contained earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading 'Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. The company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. There was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ Daniel L.

The corporation may have other offices in such places within or outside of Minnesota as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.\nARTICLE II SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS Section 1. Place. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation, or at such other place within or outside of Minnesota as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation; provided, however, that any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the corporation is located. The Board of Directors may determine that shareholders not physically present in person or by proxy at a shareholder meeting may, by means of remote communication, participate in a shareholder meeting held at a designated place. The Board of Directors also may determine that a meeting of the shareholders shall not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by means of remote communication. Participation by remote communication constitutes presence at the meeting.\nSection 2. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the shareholders shall be held annually, as soon as convenient after the close of the preceding fiscal year of the corporation, at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, for the election of directors and the transaction of other appropriate business.\nSection 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time and for any purpose or purposes by a shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that purpose, must be called by twenty-five percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote) or by the Chair of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or two or more directors. The business transacted at a special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.\nSection 4. Notice. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of shareholders, stating the date, time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which it is called, shall be given to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. Notice to a shareholder is also effectively given if the notice is addressed to the shareholder or a group of shareholders in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), so long as the corporation has first received the written or implied consent required by those rules and regulations.\nSection 5. Waiver; Objections. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting, including attendance by means of remote communication, is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.\nSection 6. Quorum; Adjourned Meetings. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of shareholders originally present leaves less than a quorum. The Chair of any meeting of shareholders may adjourn the meeting, for any reason and whether or not a quorum is present, to a time and place announced at the time of adjournment, and no further notice of the adjourned meeting shall be required.\nExhibit 3.2 Section 7. Voting and Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, every owner of shares entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy and shall have one vote for each share held. In electing directors, the voting shall be by ballot. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote (a) by filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the corporation or the corporation's duly authorized agent at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original. Any shareholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors.\nSection 8. Chair of Meeting; Conduct of Meetings. The Chair of the Board shall preside at all meetings of shareholders. In his or her absence, the Board of Directors may appoint any other officer or director to act as Chair at the meeting. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate, or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the Chair of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such Chair are necessary, appropriate, or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the Chair shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants, regulation of the opening and closing of the polls, and restricting the use of cell phones, audio, or video recording devices and similar devices at the meeting.

If a special meeting of shareholders is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors, a shareholder’s written notice of nominations to be made at the special meeting of shareholders must be delivered in writing to the General Counsel of the corporation, or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation, not less than 90 days before the meeting (or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) the date of the meeting).

The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance with this Section 9 or Section 10 below and, if the Chair should so determine, the Chair shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded or any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 9 and, if the Chair so determines, the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

Holder of Record. The corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares as the holder thereof in fact and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, or as authorized by any procedure established by resolution of the Board of Directors.\nARTICLE VI MISCELLANEOUS Section 1.

The Articles do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Company, each director of the Company shall be elected at a meeting of shareholders by the vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that director, provided that directors of the Company shall be elected by a plurality of the votes present and entitled to vote on the election of directors at any such meeting for which the number of nominees (other than nominees withdrawn on or prior to the day preceding the date the Company first mails its notice for such meeting to the shareholders) exceeds the number of directors to be elected.

Listing The Company's Common Stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol \"FAST.\" Anti-Takeover Provisions The Charter Documents and the MBCA contain certain provisions that may discourage an unsolicited takeover of the Company or make an unsolicited takeover of the Company more difficult. The following are some of the more significant anti-takeover provisions that are applicable to the Company: Business Combinations and Other Transactions with 15% Shareholders The Articles provide that, generally, (i) consolidations, mergers, statutory share exchanges and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the book value of the Company's assets involving a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (\"Voting Stock\"), (ii) the acquisition of assets from a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the Company's Voting Stock equal to or greater than 10% of the book value of the Company's assets, (iii) certain issuances of stock involving a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the Company's Voting Stock, (iv) liquidations or dissolutions of the Company proposed by or on behalf of a 15% or more beneficial shareholder, and (v) certain other specified transactions involving a 15% or more beneficial shareholder, whether or not they otherwise require a shareholder vote, require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Voting Stock, unless (a) the proposed transaction is first approved by a majority of the continuing directors (generally meaning any director whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the currently sitting directors) whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the continuing directors), or (b) the consideration to be received by the shareholders of the Company in the proposed transaction meets certain conditions generally designed to insure that shareholders receive a fair price for their shares, Exhibit 4.2 (Continued) and certain other procedural requirements in connection with the proposed transaction are followed. A 75% vote of the outstanding shares of the Company's Voting Stock is required to amend this special voting provision. Special Meetings of Shareholders; Shareholder Action by Unanimous Written Consent; and Advance Notice of Shareholder Business Proposals and Nominations Section 302A.433 of the MBCA provides that special meetings of the Company's shareholders may be called by the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, two or more directors, or shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote, except that a special meeting demanded by shareholders for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the board of directors for that purpose, must be called by 25% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote. Section 302A.441 of the MBCA also provides that action may be taken by shareholders without a meeting only by unanimous written consent. The By-Laws provide an advance written notice procedure with respect to shareholder proposals of business and shareholder nominations of candidates for election as directors. Shareholders at an annual meeting are able to consider only the proposals and nominations specified in the notice of meeting or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a shareholder that has delivered timely written notice in proper form to the Company's general counsel of the business to be brought before the meeting.\nControl Share Provision Section 302A.671 of the MBCA applies, with certain exceptions, to any acquisition of the Company's Voting Stock (from a person other than the Company and other than in connection with certain mergers and exchanges to which the Company is a party) resulting in the acquiring person owning 20% or more of the Company's Voting Stock then outstanding. Section 302A.671 requires approval of any such acquisitions by both (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, including shares held by the acquiring person, and (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, excluding all interested shares. In general, shares acquired in the absence of such approval are denied voting rights and are redeemable at their then fair market value by the Company within 30 days after the acquiring person has failed to give a timely information statement to the Company or the date the shareholders voted not to grant voting rights to the acquiring person's shares. The control share provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or in its bylaws approved by its shareholders. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nBusiness Combination Provision Section 302A.673 of the MBCA generally prohibits the Company or any of its subsidiaries from entering into any merger, share exchange, sale of material assets or similar transaction with a 10% shareholder within four years following the date the person became a 10% shareholder, unless either the transaction or the person's acquisition of shares is approved prior to the person becoming a 10% shareholder by a committee of all of the disinterested members of the board of directors. The business combination provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or its bylaws. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nTakeover Offer; Fair Price Under Section 302A.675 of the MBCA, an offeror may not acquire shares of a publicly held corporation within two years following the last purchase of shares pursuant to a takeover offer with respect to that class, including acquisitions made by purchase, exchange, merger, consolidation, partial or complete liquidation, redemption, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, or any other similar transaction, unless (i) the acquisition is approved by a committee of the board's disinterested directors before the purchase of any shares by the offeror pursuant to the earlier takeover offer, or (ii) shareholders are afforded, at the time of the proposed acquisition, a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the shares to the offeror upon substantially equivalent terms as those provided in the earlier takeover offer.\nGreenmail Restrictions Under Section 302A.553 of the MBCA, a corporation is prohibited from buying shares at an above-market price from a greater than 5% shareholder who has held the shares for less than two years unless (i) the purchase is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote or (ii) the corporation makes an equal or better offer to all shareholders for all other shares of that class or series and any other class or series into which they may be converted.\nAuthority of the Board of Directors The Company's board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of the Company's capital stock, including the authority to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock, setting forth the designation of each such series and fixing the relative rights and preferences for each such series, without seeking shareholder approval in most instances. In addition, under the By-Laws, the Company's board of directors has the right to fill vacancies of the board of directors (including a vacancy created by an increase in the size of the board of directors).\nFastenal Company Bonus Program for Executive Officers Quarterly Incentives Our executive officers are eligible for cash incentives through individual bonus arrangements based on improvements in the overall financial performance of the company and/or their respective areas of responsibility. The bonus arrangements provide our executive officers with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus for each quarter during a year when we increase our earnings above a predetermined minimum target. The primary cash bonuses for all of our named executive officers are based on growth in pre-tax earnings of the company and/ or the officer's area of responsibility. The compensation committee selected pre-tax earnings as the appropriate metric for calculating cash bonuses for those officers because of the committee's belief that the focus of the named executive officers should be on profitability, which is the primary driver of shareholder value. The cash bonus for our chief financial officer also includes a component based on growth in company-wide net earnings because his responsibilities allow him to affect our entire financial position including our tax position. The compensation committee believes that no named executive officer should earn a cash bonus under this program for a quarter unless financial performance has improved and therefore sets minimum targets for each quarter that are equal to the earnings achieved for the same quarter in the prior year. The compensation committee requires growth in earnings before any bonuses can be earned due to its belief that growth is achievable with superior effort and will generate the cash necessary to expand the company's operations in accordance with our business plans and increase shareholder value. The payout percentage used to calculate the amount of each named executive officer's primary quarterly cash bonus reflects the officer's track record in his or her current position (i.e., newly promoted executives historically have had to prove themselves in their new positions before earning higher payout percentages) and relative ability to impact profitability.\nCash bonus payments to our named executive officers are tied directly to our financial performance so that they increase only if and to the extent the company's profitability grows; therefore, we do not believe it is necessary for payouts under our primary executive cash incentive program to be capped. We believe the current design of our executive bonus arrangements, along with our other controls, adequately mitigates risk and the use of multiple metrics would not be in furtherance of our goal of keeping our compensation programs simple, understandable, and transparent, and would risk keeping our executives focused on things other than profitability, thereby depriving them of the clear feedback and motivation necessary to improve our bottom line. Therefore, we do not base these cash incentives on multiple metrics. Our named executive officers are each eligible for a supplemental bonus program. The supplemental bonus program, known as the ROA (Return on Assets) Plan, is intended to encourage better management of accounts receivable, inventory, and vehicles and provides cash incentive amounts on a quarterly basis for asset management improvement over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and is described in more detail below. Exhibit 10.1 2023 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2023 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2022. Consistent with prior years, the bonuses for 2023 were based on growth in pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility. The bonuses for each quarter were determined by applying a payout percentage to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings exceeded 100% of pre-tax earnings or net earnings for the same quarter in 2022. The compensation committee determined that the payout percentages for each of the named executive officers for 2023 would remain unchanged from those in effect at the end of 2022, except that Mr. Lewis' bonus arrangement was updated to include a component for growth in pre-tax earnings, in addition to growth in net earnings. In May 2023, when Mr. Watts was appointed to Chief Sales Officer, his bonus arrangement was updated to reflect growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings. Prior to May 2023, his bonus arrangement included growth in pre-tax earnings of our international business units and a smaller component of company-wide pre-tax growth.\nThe specific bonus opportunities for our named executive officers are summarized in the table below. Each named executive officer's cash bonus for each quarter during 2023 was determined by applying the payout percentage listed opposite his or her name below to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility for that quarter exceeded 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022 (the 'minimum target'). Name Earnings Type Payout Percentage Mr. Florness Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.75% Mr. Lewis Company-wide pre-tax earnings / Company-wide net earnings 0.50% / 0.35% Mr. Miller (1) Pre-tax earnings 1.00% / 0.25% Mr. Watts (2) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% Mr. Soderberg Company-wide pre-tax earnings 0.65% Mr. Owen (3) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% (1) The bonuses for Mr. Miller were based on growth in pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (Eastern United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 1.00%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.25%.\n(2) Prior to May 2023, the bonuses for Mr. Watts were based on growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (which were all areas outside of the United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 2.20%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.30%. (3) Mr. Owen resigned on October 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets out, for each quarter in 2023, our actual and minimum target pre-tax earnings and net earnings on a company-wide basis for that quarter, in each case rounded to the nearest thousand. (As indicated above, the 'minimum target' amount in 2023 was 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022.) 2023 Actual Pre-tax Earnings Minimum Target Pre-tax Earnings Actual Net Earnings Minimum Target Net Earnings First quarter $ 389,734,000 $ 355,714,000 $ 295,139,000 $ 269,588,000 Second quarter 392,640,000 380,745,000 298,050,000 287,102,000 Third quarter 385,389,000 375,316,000 295,367,000 284,595,000 Fourth quarter 354,226,000 328,177,000 266,429,000 245,606,000 During 2023, the approximate percentage of the actual and minimum pre-tax earnings of the company attributable to our operations in the geographic area under Mr. Miller's leadership was 47% and Mr. Watts' leadership through April was 13%. As noted above, the ROA Plan, which is designed to encourage careful management of assets, namely accounts receivable, inventories, and pick-up trucks, for 2023 was approved by the compensation committee for our named executive officers. Quarterly bonuses would be payable pursuant to the ROA Plan if a specified level of improvement in asset management relative to the comparable prior year quarter was achieved. Improvement in asset management was assessed using a two-quarter average of total assets divided by the trailing 12-month net sales, which we refer to as the 'performance percentage.' If the performance percentage when compared to the prior year benchmark showed improvement at a level specified in the table below, the named executive officer would receive the corresponding bonus amount. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout 150 basis points $ 15,000 100 basis points (but less than 150 basis points) $ 10,000 50 basis points (but less than 100 basis points) $ 5,000 In addition, for each whole percentage improvement (e.g., 41.0%, 40.0%, 39.0%, etc.) a $10,000 bonus would be payable for the quarter when the new whole percentage threshold was first achieved. We achieved improvement and paid bonus amounts to our named executive officers, pursuant to the ROA Plan for each quarter in fiscal 2023 as follows: 2023 Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout First quarter 150 basis points $ 15,000 Second quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Third quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter Whole percentage improvement (38.0% and 37.0%) 20,000 Total $ 80,000 2024 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2024 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2023. The bonus plans for our named executive officers for 2024 are unchanged from our 2023 bonus plans, except that Mr. Miller's payout percentage on pretax earnings will decrease beginning in the third quarter of 2024 while the geographic area that his bonus will be based on (United States) will increase. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Exhibit 10.2 FASTENAL COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (As amended and restated effective April 24, 2018) This Plan is adopted and made by Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation with principal offices at Winona, Minnesota (the \"Company\"), for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 1. Purpose.\nThe Fastenal Company Stock Option Plan (the \"Plan\") is intended to advance the interests of the Company, its shareholders, and its subsidiaries by encouraging and enabling selected employees upon whose judgment, initiative and effort the Company and its subsidiaries are dependent for the successful conduct of their business, to acquire and retain a proprietary interest in the Company by ownership of its Shares. All Options granted under the Plan and all Shares sold upon exercise of Options are granted and sold by the Company. Options granted under the Plan will not be options that meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"). 2. Definitions.\n(a) \"Administrator\" means the body administering the Plan, as specified in Section 9. (b) \"Board\" means the Board of Directors of the Company. (c) \"Cause\" means (i) any failure by an Optionee to materially conform to the Company's Standards of Conduct; (ii) an Optionee's continued failure or refusal to perform his or her duties to Company or any Subsidiary (except when prevented by reason of illness, disability or approved leave of absence); (iii) an Optionee willfully engaging in conduct that is, in the good faith judgment of the Board or Administrator, demonstrably and materially detrimental to the Company or any Subsidiary, financially, reputationally, or otherwise; (iv) an illegal or negligent act by an Optionee that adversely affects the Company or any Subsidiary in a material way; or (v) conviction of an Optionee of a felony involving moral turpitude. For purposes of this Plan, if an Optionee's termination of employment occurs for any reason other than Cause, and the Company thereafter discovers additional facts that the Company was not aware of as of the date of termination that would have justified a termination of employment for Cause, and if the Administrator provides the Optionee with written notice stating the newly discovered facts that support a termination for Cause within 90 days after the applicable date of termination, then the Optionee's termination of employment will be deemed for all purposes under this Plan to be a termination of employment for Cause.\n(d) \"Company\" means Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation, and any successor corporation. (e) \"Common Stock\" means the Company's $.01 par value Common Stock. (f) \"Date of Grant\" means the date on which the Administrator approves the grant of an Option under the Plan, or such later date as may be specified by the Administrator on the date the Administrator approves the grant.

If the Common Stock is not then listed and traded upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall be what the Administrator determines in good faith to be 100% of the fair market value of a Share as of the date in question. This determination by the Administrator shall be binding upon the Optionee and all other persons. (i) \"Option\" means an Option granted under the Plan. (j) \"Option Price\" means the purchase price for each Share subject to an Option as specified in paragraph 6(a) of the Plan.

(m) \"Retirement\" means any termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than for Cause, occurring at or after age 60, or at or after completing 25 years or more of continuous employment with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. (n) \"Shares\" shall mean shares of Common Stock, or such other securities or property as may become subject to Options pursuant to an adjustment as provided under Section 7 of the Plan. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (o) \"Subsidiary\" or \"Subsidiaries\" means a subsidiary corporation or corporations of the Company as defined in Section 424 of the Code. (p) \"Successor\" means the legal representative of the estate of a deceased Optionee or the person or persons who acquire the right to exercise an Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of any Optionee. 3. Shares Subject to Options.\nThe aggregate number of authorized and unissued Shares for which Options may be granted and which may be purchased upon the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 11,462,020, subject to adjustment under the provisions of paragraph 7. In the event any Option shall, for any reason, terminate or expire or be surrendered without having been exercised in full, other Options may be granted covering the Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option. The maximum number of Shares subject to Options that may be granted to any one individual under this Plan during any fiscal year of the Company (the \"Maximum Annual Grant\") is 500,000 Shares, subject to adjustment under the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan. 4. Participants.\nAll employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, subject to any criteria, categories, or limitations that may be established by the Administrator from time to time. Criteria for participation may reflect an employee's contribution to the success of the Company, including the employee's responsibility for Company revenues and profits, responsibility for managing other employees, possession of special skills, and length of service. The Administrator shall determine participation, grant Options, and specify the number of Shares subject to each Option. 5. Grant of Options.\nOptions shall be granted to employees eligible to participate in the Plan at such times and in such amounts, consistent with the Plan, as may be determined by the Administrator, as long as Shares remain available for award under the Plan, or until the Plan is terminated as provided herein. 6.

All Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement or certificate in such form and with such terms, including any conditions as to exercisability, as the Administrator may from time to time approve consistent with the Plan, subject to the following limitations and conditions: (a) Option Price. The purchase price of each Share subject to an Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant, but shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. (b) Period of Option. The expiration date with respect to each Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant. (c) Vesting of Shareholder Rights. Neither an Optionee nor any transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company until the Option has been exercised and the Shares purchased are properly issued to such Optionee or transferee. (d) Exercise of Option. The date or dates at which each Option will become exercisable and the period during which such Option may be exercised shall be determined and stated by the Administrator in the award agreement or certificate at the time of grant. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, an Option may be exercised only while the Optionee is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, and only if the Optionee has been continuously so employed since the date the Option was granted. (e) Manner of Exercise. Each exercise of an Option shall be in writing, in such form as the Administrator may prescribe, delivered to the Administrator or its designee, specifying the number of Shares being purchased and accompanied by payment of the Option Price for such Shares, by check payable to the Company or in such other manner as the Administrator may prescribe. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (f) Nontransferability of Options. No Option shall be transferable or assignable by an Optionee otherwise than by a Permitted Transfer. Each Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. No Option shall be pledged or hypothecated in any way and no Option shall be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. Any Option held by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such Option immediately prior to its transfer and may be exercised by such transferee as and to the extent that such Option has become exercisable and has not terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the applicable award agreement or certificate. For purposes of any provision of this Plan relating to notice to an Optionee or to the exercisability or termination of an option upon or following the death, disability or termination of employment of an Optionee, the references to \"Optionee\" shall mean the original grantee of an Option and not any transferee. (g) Termination of Employment. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 6(h), 6(i) or 6(j), upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of such termination of employment, and shall to that extent remain exercisable until the earlier of 90 days after the date of such termination of employment or the expiration date of such Option. The granting of an Option to an Optionee does not alter in any way the existing rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries to terminate such person's employment at any time for any reason or for no reason, nor does it confer upon such person any rights or privileges except as specifically provided for in the Plan. (h) Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, then: (1) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted prior to January 1, 2012 shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of Optionee's death, and shall to that extent remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the earlier of 13 months after the date of Optionee's death or the expiration date of such Option. (2) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement or certificate following the Optionee's death, and shall remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the expiration date of such Option.\n(i) Retirement of Optionee. If an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates due to Retirement, then any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall, subject to the following sentence, terminate except to the extent that it is vested and immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of the Optionee's Retirement, and shall to the extent vested remain exercisable until the expiration date of such Option. With respect to any Option granted on or after January 1, 2012, the Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to provide in the applicable award agreement or certificate, either at the time the Option is granted or by amendment to such award agreement or certificate while the Option is outstanding, for the accelerated or continued vesting of such Option upon or following Retirement. (j) Termination for Cause. Upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for Cause, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited. (k) Forfeiture For Breach of Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, if an Optionee who is party to a non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary violates any such agreement in any material respect, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited, and with respect to any exercise of an Option by such Optionee within a 12 month period prior to the occurrence of such violation, the Optionee shall be liable to the Company for the difference between the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Shares acquired upon such exercise and the aggregate exercise price of such Shares. The Optionee shall pay such amount promptly upon demand by the Company. (l) Demotion or Reassignment of Optionee. If at any time before an outstanding Option becomes fully exercisable the Optionee holder of such Option is transferred or reassigned to a position within the Company or any Subsidiary in which, had the Optionee been assigned to such position as of the Date of Grant of such Option, the Optionee would not have been entitled, under the Option award guidelines then being applied by the Administrator, to receive an Option award covering as many Shares as were made subject to the Option actually issued (a \"Demotion\"), then a portion (or all) of the Option will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion determined as follows: Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (1) if no portion of the outstanding Option has become exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then the portion of the Option that will be forfeited as of the effective date of the Demotion shall be equal to the difference between the number of Shares as granted to the Optionee on the Date of Grant and the number of Shares that would have been granted had the Optionee been assigned to such new position as of the Date of Grant under the Option award guidelines then applied by the Administrator. The Option will become exercisable as to the remaining Shares that are not forfeited on a pro rata basis in accordance with the original exercisability schedule; or (2) if a portion of the outstanding Option was exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then it will remain exercisable during the remaining term of the Option, but the portion of the Option not yet exercisable as of the effective date of the Demotion will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion consistent with Section 6(l)(i) above. 7. Adjustments. (a) Except as provided in paragraph 7(c), in the event of a capital adjustment resulting from a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, or a combination or exchange of Shares, the number and kind of Shares subject to the Plan and the Maximum Annual Grant and the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable shall be adjusted consistent with such capital adjustment. The Option price of any Share under each outstanding Option shall be adjusted so that there will be no change in the aggregate purchase price payable upon exercise of the unexercised portion of such Option. The granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reorganizations, reclassifications, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. (b) In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time. (c) In the event of a Reorganization (as hereinafter defined) in which the Company is not the surviving or acquiring company, or in which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization, then: (1) If there is no plan or agreement respecting the Reorganization (\"Reorganization Agreement\") or if the Reorganization Agreement does not specifically provide for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time; or (2) If there is a Reorganization Agreement and if the Reorganization Agreement specifically provides for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then the securities received on account of such Shares shall be subject to the Plan and then-outstanding Options. The Administrator may make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares for the purchase of which Options may be granted under the Plan and for the Maximum Annual Grant. In addition, the Administrator shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end that the interest of the holder of the Option shall, to the extent practicable, be maintained as before the occurrence of such event. Such adjustment in outstanding Options shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Option but with a corresponding adjustment in the Option price per Share. The term \"Reorganization\" as used in this paragraph (c) of this Section 7 shall mean any statutory merger, statutory consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale, pursuant to an agreement with the Company, of securities of the Company pursuant to which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (d) Adjustments and determinations under this Section 7 shall be made by the Administrator as specified herein, and its decisions as to what adjustments or determinations shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 8. Restrictions on Issuing Shares. The exercise of each Option and the issuance of Shares in connection therewith shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the Administrator shall determine in its discretion that the satisfaction of withholding tax or other withholding liabilities, or that the listing, registration, or qualification of any Shares otherwise deliverable upon such exercise upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or that the consent or approval of any regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, such exercise or the delivery or purchase of Shares pursuant thereto, then in any such event, such exercise shall not be effective unless such withholding, listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Administrator. 9. Administration of Plan. (a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board or by a committee of two or more directors of the Company appointed by the Board (the \"Administrator\"). If the Plan is administered by a committee, it shall report all actions taken by it to the Board. In administering the Plan, the Administrator shall be governed by and shall adhere to the provisions of the Plan, including any criteria for eligibility or participation established by the Board from time to time. Subject to the foregoing, the Administrator shall determine eligibility to participate in the Plan, ascertain the number of Shares for which each participant is eligible in accordance with any established criteria, grant Options, construe and interpret the Plan, and make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. All such actions and determinations shall be conclusively binding for all purposes and upon all persons. The Administrator may delegate administrative authority under this Plan to such officers or employees of the Company or others as it may determine, except that any authority so delegated shall not extend to granting and administering awards to persons who are then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Options granted to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are intended to be granted either by the Board or by a committee composed entirely of \"non-employee directors\" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and \"outside directors\" as defined in and in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code. (b) To the greatest extent permitted by law, (i) no member or former member of the Administrator shall be liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan, and (ii) the members or former members of the Administrator shall be entitled to indemnification by the Company against and from any loss incurred by such members by reason of any such actions and determinations. 10. Delivery of Shares and Proceeds. Upon the exercise of an Option, the Administrator shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued by the Company's transfer agent and a certificate or statement of issuance to be delivered to the Optionee. The proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall be the property of the Company, and shall be delivered to it promptly by the Administrator. 11. Amendment, Suspension, or Termination of Plan.\nThe Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan or may amend it from time to time in such respects as it may deem advisable in order that the Options granted thereunder may conform to any changes in the law or in any other respect which it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company. Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate when all available Shares have been granted and no granted Option is outstanding. No Option may be granted during any suspension or after the termination of the Plan. No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall, without an Optionee's consent, impair any of the rights or obligations under any outstanding Option theretofore granted to such Optionee under the Plan. An Optionee's consent to any amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan or to any Option issued pursuant to the Plan shall be deemed to have been given if the Optionee fails to object in writing within 15 days after written notice thereof, given in person or by certified mail sent to the Optionee's address contained in the records of the Company. To the extent considered necessary to comply with applicable provisions of law or the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other applicable recognized national securities exchange, any such amendments to the Plan may be made subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) 12. Adoption and Effective Date of Plan. The Plan was originally approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2003, and approved by the shareholders of the Company on April 15, 2003.

Florness Holden Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Executive Officer) (Principal Financial Officer) FASTENAL COMPANY COMPENSATION FORFEITURE, RECOVERY AND TRUE-UP POLICY (Adopted October 11, 2023) Policy The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Fastenal Company (the \"Company\") has adopted this Compensation Forfeiture and Recovery Policy (this \"Policy\") pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, upon a Recoupment Event, each Covered Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company, reasonably promptly, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was received by such Covered Executive during the Lookback Period. In addition, to the extent that the Company underpaid incentive compensation due to inaccurate financial statements, Covered Executives will be reimbursed for the difference.\nAdministration This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\"). Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nDefinitions \"Accounting Restatement\" means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that (a) is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a \"Big R\" restatement) or (b) would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a \"little r\" restatement).\n\"Covered Executive\" means each of the Company's current and former Section 16 Officers.\n\"Erroneously Awarded Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the excess of the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period over the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\n\"Financial Reporting Measures\" are any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n\"Incentive-Based Compensation\" is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n\"Lookback Period\" means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company's fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nA \"Recoupment Event\" occurs when the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Required Restatement Date\" means the earlier to occur of: (x) the date the Company's Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Section 16 Officer\" is defined as an \"officer\" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act.\n\"Section 409A\" means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.\nExhibit 97 \"True-Up Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, any additional amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period, had the Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated financial statements.\nAmount Subject to Recovery The Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy includes such compensation that is received by a Covered Executive (i) on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded or granted prior to this date), (ii) after the individual began service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if the individual served as a Section 16 Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation, and (iv) while the Company is publicly traded.\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery from a Covered Executive upon a Recoupment Event is the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which amount shall be determined by the Committee.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nRecovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation Promptly following a Recoupment Event, the Committee will determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive, and the Company will provide each such Covered Executive with a written notice of such amount and a demand for repayment or return. Upon receipt of such notice, each affected Covered Executive shall promptly repay or return such Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company. If the Covered Executive repays, chooses to forfeit, or returns Erroneously Awarded Compensation within a reasonable period of time (generally not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of notification from the Company or as otherwise agreed to by the Company), the Covered Executive may elect to repay, forfeit or return the Erroneously Awarded Compensation by timely: (i) transferring funds to the Company, (ii) forfeiting any compensation that is not yet payable; or (iii) forfeiting stock options that the Covered Executive has received from the Company, whether vested or unvested, with an equivalent value to the Erroneously Award Compensation. If the Covered Executive does not timely repay, forfeit or return Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Company shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method determined by the Committee, provided that recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be made in compliance with Section 409A. The applicable Covered Executive shall also be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses (including legal fees) reasonably incurred by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\nLimited Exceptions Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be recovered in accordance with this Policy unless the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions is met: • the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, provided the Company has first made a reasonable effort to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation; or • the recovery would likely cause a U.S. tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\nReliance on any of the above exemptions will further comply with applicable listing standards, including without limitation, documenting the reason for the impracticability and providing required documentation to Nasdaq.\nNo Insurance or Indemnification The Company will not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (or related expenses incurred by the Covered Executive) pursuant to a recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy, nor will it pay or reimburse a Covered Executive for any insurance premiums on any insurance policy obtained by the Covered Executive to protect against the forfeiture or recovery of any compensation pursuant to this Policy.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Additional Incentive Compensation Due to a Covered Executive In the event of an Accounting Restatement, any True-Up Compensation due to a Covered Executive during the Look-Back Period will be paid to the Covered Executive as soon as practicable, but not later than the March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the Accounting Restatement was complete. The amount of any True-Up Compensation shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. However, in any payment of any True-Up Compensation must comply with Section 409A; in the event that a payment otherwise due under this Policy would not be in compliance with Section 409A, the amount will be forfeited. In addition, in no event whatsoever shall the Company or its officers, directors, employees or agents be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Executive by Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.\nInterpretation The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy shall be applied and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10D-1 and any applicable regulations, rules or standards adopted by SEC or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. In the event that this Policy does not meet the requirements of Rule 10D-1, the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed, this Policy shall be deemed to be amended to meet such requirements.\nAmendment; Termination The Board or the Committee may amend this Policy in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with the regulations adopted by the SEC under Rule 10D-1 and the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. The Board or the Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if that amendment or termination would cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed.\nOther Recoupment Rights Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar provision in any compensation plan agreement, and any other legal remedies available to the Company. This Policy is in addition to any other clawback or compensation recovery, recoupment or forfeiture policy that may be adopted by the Company from time to time, or any laws, rules or listing standards applicable to the Company, including without limitation, the Company's right to recoup compensation subject to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but shall supersede and replace in its entirety the Company's existing Executive Incentive Recoupment Policy adopted by the Board in 2016. To the extent that application of this Policy would provide for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that the Company recovers pursuant to another policy or provision, the amount that is recovered will be credited to the required recovery under this Policy.\nSuccessors This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Annual Meeting The annual meeting of shareholders will be at 10:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, on Thursday, April 25, 2024, at the Remlinger Muscle Car Museum located at 3560 Service Drive, Winona, Minnesota.\nHome Office Fastenal Company 2001 Theurer Boulevard Winona, Minnesota 55987-0978 Phone: 507-454-5374 I Fax: 507-453-8049 Legal Counsel Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota Form 10-K A copy of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is available without charge to shareholders upon written request to Investor Relations at the address of our home office listed on this page.

Please send updates/corrections to editor@mdm.com .\n© 2024 Modern Distribution Management. All rights reserved.\n3 2024 MDM Top Distributors Lists Latest updates at mdm.com/top_distributors Continued on next page Normalization and Tougher Comparables Welcome to Modern Distribution Management’s 2024 Top Distributors feature, now in its 15th year. Here, you’ll find our rankings of North America’s largest distributors of industrial, commercial and building supply products, based on their 2023 fiscal revenue within 20 different industry verticals. More than 200 different companies are represented across these various lists.\nIt’s MDM’s biggest research project of the year.\nBefore you dive into our rankings in the pages ahead, let's set the stage for the key factors that shaped this year’s feature and key context you should know when perusing our lists.\n2023: Strong Start, Late Fade Since our lists are based purely on 2023 fiscal rev-enues for all distributors, that year is worth examining from a high level.\nAfter riding the inflation wave in 2021 and 2022, distributors found 2023 to be less advantageous from an economic tailwind perspective. While inflation persisted throughout 2023 and has since, it leveled out throughout the year and led to far tougher year-over-year financial comparables. Meanwhile, publicly-traded distributors began to mention demand softening as early as 1Q23 quarterly earnings reports, with that ramping up as the year progressed.\nDisinflation and lower volumes resulted in the U.S. wholesale distribution sector finishing with 2023 annual revenues of $7.887 trillion, according to the MDM Forecast, which strips out agents and brokers, manufac-turers' sales branches and offices, importers and export-ers. That was down 1.8% after soaring 14.8% and 20.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSource: MDM Forecast But, it’s important to keep in mind the context that while 2023 was a downstep in overall revenue, that was compared to a record-setting and inflated previous two years. Far removed from direct impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2023 may be remembered as the first ‘normal’ year since 2019 in terms of supply chain con-ditions and escalating inflation.\nThe vast majority of the distributors on our lists posted modest annual sales gains or declines in 2023, while pockets of others outperformed their competition or were hit hard by market-specific factors. That’s continued through the first half of 2024, with firms still facing tough comps vs. the first and second quarters of a year earlier. Industry-Specific Revenue Like for the past several years, this is the most import-ant part of this introduction. Starting in 2022, MDM put a heightened emphasis on ranking companies by their sector-specific revenues rather than total revenue.\nThis also explains why you’ll see some distributors with smaller total revenues ranked higher than others within the same industry.\nTake Grainger, for example. By its total 2023 reve-nue of $16.5 billion, Grainger is North America’s largest industrial supplies distributor. But when digging into its financial reports and product sector breakouts, we find that it’s also one of North America’s top distributors of electrical, HVACR, plumbing, power transmission, fluid power and safety products. This is why Grainger ended up appearing on 10 of our 20 sector lists — the company’s revenue within each of those segments is large enough to warrant a spot. And this is why Watsco is ranked No. 1 in HVACR and Grainger is No. 5 despite Watsco’s $7.3 bil-lion in 2023 revenue being much smaller than Grainger’s $16.5 billion — Watsco’s HVACR revenue was much high-er than Grainger’s.\nThis explains why you’ll find some companies chart-ed on industry lists outside of their “core” offering. For example, Graybar is best known as an electrical products distributor, but its industrial products sales were large emough to chart at No. 20 on our Industrial Supplies list. It’s also why Ferguson appears on our lists for Industrial Supplies, Building Materials/Construction and Safety, besides its hallmarks of Plumbing, HVACR and Industrial PVF.\nBut while our rankings are based on 2023 revenue within each sector, the revenue you see displayed on our lists is overall revenue. Why? Quite simply, while many privately-owned distributors elected not to publicly share their total revenues, far fewer still elected not to publicly share their sector-specific revenues. If we displayed the sector-specific revenues of those that gave us the OK to, they’d be few and far between. The overall revenue figure gives us something to show for the majority of companies on our lists.\nThat sector-specific revenue breakout is the most painstaking part of our research process, as it involves an incredible amount of hair-splitting and triangulation to find accurate revenues. It makes this feature all the more challenging, but we do it because it results in a more accu-rate list and levels the playing field. © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

For distributors that don’t follow a January-December fiscal calendar, we’ve noted that with an asterisk and a footnote. To normalize the way we display the rankings, we include total company revenues, rather than break out individual sector revenues. Companies were asked to provide data about revenues, with information sup-plemented by quarterly fiscal reports, SEC filings and publicly available information. For companies that elect to not share revenue data, MDM estimates their relative po-sition in its sector list based on the best available industry resources and information. Note: Companies that operate primarily as master distributors are not eligible for Top Distributors inclusion. 3 New List Segments With the support from MDM’s integration into the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, we were able to add three list cagories to our feature — Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare, Food & Beverage and Lubricants & Fuels. This expansion helps our feature rep-resent even more of the wholesale distribution industry. Where's Amazon Business?\nMDM readers who have regularly seen our Top Distributors lists over the years may notice that we don’t include the industry’s biggest elephant in the room: Amazon Business. The B2B supplies marketplace ap-peared in the top six of our Industrial Supplies list since first appearing in 2018, including at No. 2 in 2022. While the platform is certainly competing directly with indus-trial, commercial and building supply distributors for market share to a tune of $35 billion in 2022 revenue, we made the decision last year to omit it from our lists due to Amazon Business’ very unique business model. It was the only company on our lists in previous years that couldn’t be described as a distributor. We do, however, include The Home Depot’s Pro segment, which directly operates via distribution sales, services and logistics. To Keep in Mind As you peruse the rankings across these different verticals, it’s important to remember that the way we put them together is not an exact science. While our editorial team made every effort to extract revenue information from the non-publicly-traded distributors listed here, many companies are understandably private with that information. We are happy to keep that revenue informa-tion strictly private and only use it internally for rankings, which an increasing number of companies opt for each year. So, when you see “N/A” listed for revenue, that likely means that revenue figure was confidentially given to MDM and to not be published.\nEven with that understanding, a smaller number of companies would rather not budge on sharing their revenue. Given the amount of large distributors that have been privately-acquired in recent years, this isn’t a sur-prise. In these cases where revenue isn’t shared, our team triangulates with respected industry experts and the best available information to estimate and rank distributors appropriately.\nAnother nugget to note is that since we used fiscal 2023 revenues for all companies, the revenues of handful of companies that don’t follow a traditional 12-month fiscal calendar represent a time difference by as much as nine months. We’ve denoted distributors that don’t follow a traditional fiscal calendar with an asterisk next to their revenue and a footnote. Questions? Comments?\nAs alluded to above, there is no perfect way to conduct these rankings. I’m sure there are MDM readers who will disagree with where and how certain companies are slotted on our list, and that’s OK, especially given our focus on sector-specific revenue. I’m very open to comments and suggestions for how we can improve this feature going forward. Don’t hesitate to reach out.\nMike Hockett Executive Editor Modern Distribution Management © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

While every MRO product may be considered an industrial product, the opposite isn’t always true. For MDM, MRO products are those needed to keep a company’s facilities and production processes running smoothly, whereas industrial products encompass MRO in addition to products involved in the manufacturing process and/or components used in the final product.\n*MSC's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 *Applied's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

These products allow a range of industries, for example, construction and factories, to perform their work. The industrial distribution market is expanding partly due to increasing industrialization, demand for rapid shipping, smart technology, and a more innovative supply chain.\n\nThe distributors make sure the product gets from the warehouse to the truck, to the facility, through a combination of warehouse space, trucks, and software methods. Examples of distributors are Motion Industries, Fastenal, and W.W. Grainger. With the increase in different industries and the increase in their respective volume, the need for a distributor is critical and will become more important. This market plays an important role in helping businesses perform their work, while keeping the U.S. economy strong and competitive.\n\n## **What Are the Market Trends in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nThe market trends in the U.S. industrial distribution market are characterized by the increasing popularity of just-in-time delivery, increasing adoption of greener practices, and data analytics in the industry.\n\n* Companies want products to be delivered quickly and only when they need them.\n* Greener practices like energy-efficient warehouses and electric trucks are being implemented more.\n* Data analytics help businesses track their inventory and improve their planning.\n* Increasing population density is leading to an increase in the demand for industrial goods, as the demand for all sorts of products and services increases.\n\n## **What Are the Restraints in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nThe growth of the U.S. industrial distribution market faces restraints such as high fuel prices, labor shortages in certain parts of the nation, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition from the large online sellers.\n\n* High fuel prices increase shipping and delivery costs for distributors.\n* Labor shortages in warehouses and logistics slow product movement.\n* Global supply chain disruptions slow product availability in the U.S.\n* Increased competition from large online sellers (example), Amazon harms smaller distributors.\n\n## **What Are the Opportunities in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market?**\n\nOpportunities emerging in the U.S. industrial distribution market stem from the increasing adoption of robots and automation machines in smart warehouses, increasing local activities, and a boom in small firms in the country.\n\n* Robots, barcode scanners, and Internet sensors let smart warehouses move fast and cut mistakes.\n* Bringing factories back to the U.S. raises local need for belts, motors, and other shop supplies.\n* A wave of new small firms drives fresh sales of tools, gloves, hard hats, and other safety gear.\n\n## **Recent Developments in the U.S. Industrial Distribution Market:**\n\n* In February 2025, new U.S. orders for metalworking machines climbed to $389.9 million, a jump of 9.9% over January and 12.5% above February 2024; year-to-date totals now stand at $744.74 million, an 8.8% gain compared with last year.\n* In May 2025, as part of a broader leadership overhaul, SureWerx named Scott Dowell as chief executive, effective May 27, 2025, with a mandate to spur organic growth and drive a more aggressive mergers-and-acquisitions agenda.\n* In June 2025, MSC Industrial Supply earned Great Place to Work certification in the U.S. for a second straight year and secured first-time accolades in Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., with 75% of employees saying the company is a wonderful employer.\n\n## **U.S. Industrial Distribution Market Companies:**\n\n* Motion Industries (Genuine Parts Company)\n* **[W.W.

I have gathered 2023–2024 primary sources (Grainger 2023 10‑K, Fastenal 2023 Annual Report, MSC investor materials index, MDM 2024 Top Distributors lists, Statifacts market databook) and can synthesize a Porter’s Five Forces analysis for the U.S. General Industrial Supplies market (MRO/industrial distribution). I will finish and produce a full five‑forces diagnosis, evidence-based implications, and actionable strategic recommendations for incumbents and new entrants using the collected information.

I used the primary sources you collected (Grainger 2023 10‑K, Fastenal 2023 annual materials, MSC investor page, Modern Distribution Management Top Distributors lists, and Statifacts U.S. industrial distribution market datagrist) plus my knowledge of distribution economics to build an evidence‑based Porter’s Five Forces view of the U.S. General Industrial Supplies (MRO/industrial distribution) market.

Key inputs and observations used:
- Grainger 2023 10‑K: scale (>$16B), two business models (high‑touch + endless assortment), supply chain investments, supplier base and international sourcing, eCommerce strategy — supports buyer information availability, supplier exposure to Asia, scale advantages, and differentiated service models.
- Fastenal 2023 annual report: large installed local network, Onsite and FMI (vending/bin) growth, strong focus on local service + digital footprint — supports importance of last‑mile presence, switching costs for integrated services, and how digital + local combine to create differentiation.
- MSC investor materials: large MRO player, public company metrics and product mix — used to triangulate competitive landscape and margin structures.
- MDM Top Distributors lists: market competitors and concentration across specialized verticals (industrial, electrical, HVACR, safety, etc.) — supports fragmentation at product level but concentration among multi‑vertical national players.
- Statifacts market databook: market size and CAGR projections (mid single‑digits) and product mix trends — used to estimate growth and industry attractiveness.

I synthesized those facts into each Porter force: assessing concentration and bargaining leverage, the role of digital/eCommerce and marketplaces (information availability), capital and scale barriers, threat of substitutes (marketplaces/direct sourcing, automation of procurement), and the intensity and nature of rivalry (fragmented but with large national/platform players). I then translated those diagnoses into short, actionable strategic recommendations and prioritized opportunities and threats with practical moves for incumbents and for potential entrants.

Limits: revenue figures and competitive breakouts vary by source and company reporting; for privately held firms some revenues are estimated. The analysis focuses on U.S. market dynamics and the MRO/general industrial supply model (branches + Onsite + FMI + eCommerce).

[[ ## porters_analysis ## ]]
{"category":"General Industrial Supplies","region":"United States","executive_summary":"The U.S. General Industrial Supplies (MRO/industrial distribution) market is large, moderately growing (mid single digits), and structurally mixed: highly fragmented by local/commodity SKUs but concentrated among scale players (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC, Motion, Wesco, Ferguson, etc.) for national and multi‑vertical accounts. Competitive advantage is moving from pure assortment and price toward integrated local service + digital visibility (FMI: vending/bin), analytics and supply‑chain solutions. Buyers are better informed and eCommerce/marketplaces increase price transparency, but switching costs rise materially when firms provide vendor‑managed inventory/Onsite programs and integration. Suppliers have pockets of power on specialty/differentiated components and materials (steel, electronics), and the industry remains dependent on Asian sourcing for many fasteners and commodity components. The overall industry attractiveness is Medium: margin pressure in commoditized products is real, but companies that scale capabilities in service, automation, supplier risk management, and analytics can sustain premium returns.","industry_attractiveness":"Medium — large addressable market with steady growth but strong downward price pressure for commodities and stronger buyer information. Attractive for companies that can combine scale, local presence, and digital/managed‑service offerings (FMI/Onsite). Less attractive for low‑scale, commodity‑only entrants.","opportunities":["Scale local + digital: expand vendor‑managed inventory (FMI) and Onsite deployments to lock in recurring, sticky revenue and higher wallet share","Specialize & bundle services: cross‑sell safety, adhesives, inventory management and light contract manufacturing to raise share of wallet","Nearshoring & supplier diversification: reduce single‑source risk by qualifying regional suppliers and dual‑sourcing critical SKUs","Analytics & procurement automation: sell PO automation, FAST360‑style dashboards and demand forecasting to enterprise customers","LIFTs and micro‑DCs: use localized fulfillment hubs to lower service cost and speed replenishment for vending/bin systems"],"threats":["Commoditization and price erosion from eCommerce marketplaces (including large eRetailers) for non‑managed items","Supply chain shocks (geopolitics/Asia concentration) and raw‑material volatility (steel, copper) that compress margins or force inventory builds","Cybersecurity, data privacy and third‑party vendor risk as FMI and eProcurement expand","Customer direct sourcing / manufacturer disintermediation for high‑volume or proprietary parts"],"threats_of_new_entrants":{"capital_requirements":"Medium to High — initial investment in distribution centers, local network, and technology for competitive service. Lower capital for pure eCommerce plays.","economies_of_scale":"High — scale matters for preferred pricing, rapid replenishment and logistics efficiency. Existing national players benefit from large purchasing volumes and dense DC/branch networks.","barriers_to_entry":["Local physical footprint and logistics capability (DCs, vans)","Supplier relationships and private label sourcing","IT & product data management for eCommerce and FMI","Customer trust for inventory‑management/Onsite programs"],"brand_loyalty":"Medium — established relationships and long contracts favor incumbents for enterprise and critical MRO spend;

however, national account customers (and large contractors) concentrate significant spending and have negotiating leverage","price_sensitivity":"Medium to High — for commoditized SKUs buyers are very price sensitive; for managed services (FMI, Onsite, KeepStock) price sensitivity lowers and focus shifts to total cost of ownership","switching_costs":"Low to High — low for spot buys and basic consumables; high for vendor‑managed inventory, Onsite/KeepStock, and integrated eProcurement due to process, ERP integrations, and operational disruption","backward_integration_threat":"Low to Medium — limited threat for most buyers, but large sophisticated OEMs may purchase certain items directly or vertically integrate in categories where they can achieve cost advantage","information_availability":"High — buyers have wide access to price transparency (marketplaces, eCatalogs) and product data; digital tools and analytics make benchmarking and switching easier","key_insights":["Buyer power is strongest for commoditized, price‑sensitive SKUs and weaker for integrated services where vendors remove operational burden","Digital channels and marketplaces have materially increased buyer information and simplified price comparison across suppliers","National account consolidation favors distributors that can deliver integrated solutions across locations rather than spot‑price sellers"],"power_level":"Medium"},"bargaining_power_suppliers":{"supplier_concentration":"Low to Medium overall; High for certain inputs — many categories have many suppliers, but critical raw materials (steel, certain fastener grades, specialized components) and some branded or proprietary products are concentrated","switching_costs":"Low to Medium — distributors commonly multi‑source; switching costs rise for private label or proprietary SKUs and when qualification/testing is required","forward_integration_threat":"Low to Medium — manufacturers may sell direct for some categories (or through exclusive distributors); limited ability for raw material suppliers to go fully forward at scale in specialized distribution channels","supplier_dependency":"Medium — distributors depend on global suppliers (Asia) for cost‑effective fasteners and many components; this creates supply‑risk exposure","unique_resources":["Private label programs / co‑branded SKUs","Proprietary component lines and exclusive agency agreements","Large overseas manufacturing footprints and capacity"],"key_insights":["Suppliers exert power in tight or proprietary SKU categories and when global capacity or logistics constrain availability","Dependence on Asia for many commodity fasteners and private label items raises risk from tariffs, shipping disruption and geopolitics","Distributors mitigate supplier power by multi‑sourcing, strategic private label, and long‑term contracts"],"power_level":"Medium"},"competitive_rivalry":{"industry_concentration":"Moderate — nationally there are several very large players (Grainger, Fastenal, MSC, Motion, Wesco/Ferguson for certain verticals) but most market segments remain served by many small local/regional distributors","industry_growth_rate":"Medium/steady — market growth in the mid‑single digits (statifacts and industry forecasts), although 2023 normalized after the inflationary 2021‑22 environment","differentiation_level":"Low to Medium — low for commodity SKUs (price/cost/availability compete); medium for specialized solutions (FMI, Onsite, inventory services, technical support and integrated eProcurement)","exit_barriers":["Real estate and lease obligations for branches and DCs can be material","Customer contracts and reputational costs make exits complex in local markets"],"industry_maturity":"Maturing — portions are mature and competitive on price while services/digital capabilities are the main growth area","intensity_level":"High — intense price competition on commoditized items; differentiation and margin reside in services, data, and supply‑chain execution","key_insights":["Competition is fiercest in commoditized SKUs and in areas with low switching costs","Value accrues to firms that tie digital procurement, on‑site inventory services, and local fulfillment into a single solution","M&A and roll‑ups continue as strategic levers for scale and geographic coverage"],"major_competitors":["W.W.

I'll start by searching for market-size, major players, distribution channels, and recent trends for the "General Industrial Supplies" market in the United States (including key distributors like Grainger, Fastenal, MSC, HD Supply), plus industry trends (e-commerce, consolidation, supplier concentration, procurement practices). This will provide sources to analyze each of Porter's Five Forces. After reviewing search results I'll extract key pages for deeper content if needed.

GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES At Grainger, we believe our success is measured by the positive impact we have on our customers, communities and team members. That is why our purpose, We Keep The World Working, ® is embedded in everything we do – it shapes our decisions, fuels our performance and inspires our more than 26,000 team members each day. In 2023, the Grainger Team strengthened our operational and service advantage in both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segments and once again showed that we can deliver strong results which include: •\tDelivered daily sales growth of 8.6% (9.5% in daily, organic constant currency) •\tOutgrew the U.S. maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) market by approximately 525 basis points in the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business •\tIncreased registered users by 14% in the total Endless Assortment model •\tExpanded operating margins by 130 basis points to 15.7% •\tProduced adjusted ROIC of 42.8%, up more than 200 basis points versus prior year •\tGenerated record operating cash flow of more than $2.0 billion •\tReturned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases While proud of what we accomplished in 2023, we remain committed to winning for the long term. Over the past few years, we’ve set out to accelerate our investments in supply chain capacity and technology to further strengthen our competitive advantage. The expansion of our supply chain network, including the recently announced distribution centers in Oregon and Texas as well as three new bulk warehouses, will contribute an additional 3.5 million square feet to the U.S. network – a more than 35% increase from the start of the year. This expansion enhances our operational efficiency and supports our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nIn addition to our supply chain expansion, we continue to build key technology infrastructure capabilities focused on two main domains that affect the customer experience: 1. Product Information Management, knowing our products better than anyone else, and 2. Customer Information Management, knowing our customers better than anyone else. These assets store, codify and scale our data, allowing us to leverage our deep product knowledge and understanding of the customer to enhance D.G.

We received numerous workplace recognitions in 2023, which highlight the positive impact of the Grainger Edge on our team member experience and enhance our reputation as a great employer. These achievements are a testament to our unwavering commitment to creating a work environment that fosters growth, collaboration and a shared sense of purpose.\nAs we close out 2023, I want to acknowledge someone who has made a meaningful impact on the Grainger culture. This year, Ann Hailey will retire from the Grainger Board of Directors after 18 years of service. I would like to thank Ann for her leadership, service, strategic counsel and the significant contributions she has provided to Grainger. It has been a true privilege to serve alongside her, and I wish her the very best in retirement.\nSince opening our doors in 1927, Grainger has built a deep trust with our customers as we strive to be their go-to partner to fulfill their MRO needs. As we look to 2024 and beyond, our team will advance the Grainger Edge to remain focused on what matters: delivering on our growth drivers to improve the customer experience, providing exceptional service, strengthening our culture and meeting our financial goals across both models.\nThank you for your continued support, investment and trust in Grainger.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “forecast,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” or “would,” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.\nGrainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Grainger's control, which could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those that are presented.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: inflation, higher product costs or other expenses, including operational and administrative expenses; the impact of macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical trends, changes and events; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; changes in customer or product mix; increased competitive pricing pressures; changes in third-party practices regarding digital advertising; failure to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory basis with group purchasing organizations; failure to develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies, including with respect to Grainger's eCommerce platforms; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in Grainger's gross profit margin; Grainger's responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, regulations related to advertising, marketing and the Internet, consumer protection, pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes), product liability, compliance or safety, trade and export compliance, general commercial disputes, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, including new or stricter environmental laws or regulations; government contract matters; the impact of any government shutdown; disruption or breaches of information technology or data security systems involving Grainger or third parties on which Grainger depends; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including tariffs and trade issues and policies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including price and trading volume volatility or price declines of Grainger's common stock; commodity price volatility; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; outbreaks of pandemic disease or viral contagions; natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather and other catastrophes or conditions; effects of climate change; failure to execute on our efforts and programs related to environmental, social and governance matters; competition for, or failure to attract, retain, train, motivate and develop executives and key team members; loss of key members of management or key team members; loss of operational flexibility and potential for work stoppages or slowdowns if team members unionize or join a collective bargaining arrangement; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; Grainger's incurrence of indebtedness or failure to comply with restrictions and obligations under its debt agreements and instruments and other factors identified under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could impact Grainger's forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward looking-statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 4 PART I Item 1: Business W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nFor financial information regarding the Company, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe Grainger Edge Grainger's strategic framework, “The Grainger Edge,” uniquely defines the Company by asserting why it exists, how it serves customers and how team members work together to achieve its objectives. Grainger’s purpose is We Keep the World Working®, which in turn allows customers to focus on the core of their businesses and do what they do best. This framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities as Grainger executes its strategy and creates value for shareholders. For further information on the Company's principles, see below \"Workplace Practices and Policies.\" General Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) and Endless Assortment. These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment. For further segment information, see Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nBelow is a description of Grainger’s reportable segments and other businesses. High-Touch Solutions N.A. The Company's High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment provides value-added MRO solutions that are rooted in deep product knowledge and customer expertise. The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment primarily includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.\nEndless Assortment The Company’s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company’s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.\nOther Other businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's Cromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment. 5 Business Models Competing with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's business models: 6 Customers The Company uses a combination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million customers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger’s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost of procurement. Customers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology. Sales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock®, Grainger's inventory management solution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat. In the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.\nProducts and Services Grainger’s product offering is grouped under several broad categories, including safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools. Products are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised more than 20% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price and product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer approximately 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 13 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 22 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically adding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.\nDistribution and Sources of Supply In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering. More than 5,000 primary suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with more than 1.4 million products stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised more than 5% of Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger’s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support. Additionally, Grainger offers comprehensive inventory management through its KeepStock® program that includes vendor-managed inventory, customer-managed inventory and onsite vending machines. 7 In the Endless Assortment segment, orders are placed primarily through online channels. Zoro leverages the High-Touch Solution N.A.'s DC network and third-party drop shipments to deliver seamless service and product fulfillment to customers. MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.\nFor further information on the Company’s properties, see Part I, Item 2: Properties of this Form 10-K.\nTrademarks and Service Marks Grainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2023 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®, SPEEDAIRE®, AIR HANDLER®, TOUGH GUY®, WESTWARD®, CONDOR® and LUMAPRO®. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK® brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.\nSeasonality Grainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger’s operating results.\nCompetition Grainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support. Government Regulations Grainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. based operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2023, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.\nHuman Capital The Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger’s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board. Grainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger’s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and team member engagement.\nTeam Member Profile As of December 31, 2023, Grainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,200 were full-time and 2,900 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 85% of these team members are located in North America, 9% in Asia and 6% in Europe. 8 Workplace Practices and Policies The Company's strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.\nThe Grainger Edge principles also guide the Company’s actions supporting health and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, and team member experience, including talent acquisition and team member retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are: • Start with the Customer • Win as One Team • Embrace Curiosity • Invest in our Success • Act with Intent • Do the Right Thing • Compete with Urgency Grainger’s purpose-driven culture and principles help the Company attract, retain, motivate and develop its workforce and drive team member engagement. The Company believes an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company and measures team member engagement on an ongoing basis. The results from engagement surveys are used to inform programs and processes designed and implemented to enhance the inclusive culture Grainger aspires to achieve. Health and Safety Grainger strives to provide a safe work environment in which team members are properly prepared to perform the many tasks required to support customers. The Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to integrate EHS into Grainger’s business operations and comply with applicable regulations. To that end, the Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to confirm proper safety policies, programs and procedures. The Company is focused on promoting a culture of safety and education. Operational team members must complete routine training to fully understand the expectation of behaviors defined by the Company’s global EHS policy. Managing and reducing risks at DCs and other facilities remain a core objective and injury rates continue to be low. In 2023, the Company’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate in the U.S. was 1.3 and the Company’s Lost Time Incident Rate in the U.S. was 0.4 based upon the number of incidents per 100 team members (or per 200,000 work hours). Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Grainger believes a diverse talent pool is essential to live its principles, foster innovation, build high-performing teams and drive business results. The Company understands that future business success requires a mix of current and new skill sets, multiple experiences, and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, and strives to reflect this priority in its hiring, retention and promotion practices. The Company aspires to increasingly promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people – regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or experiences – through recruiting outreach, internal networking, business resource groups and mentoring programs.\nGrainger's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top. The Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of approximately 31% female and 23% racially and ethnically diverse directors. Grainger also maintains this strong commitment with the CEO's leadership team and throughout the organization. The CEO's U.S. based leadership team is comprised of approximately 40% women and approximately 30% racially and ethnically diverse leaders. As of December 31, 2023, within Grainger’s U.S. workforce, approximately 39% of team members were women and approximately 37% of team members were racially and ethnically diverse. Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development Grainger believes that a great customer experience starts with a great team member experience. The Company is committed to providing team members with resources designed to help them succeed. Grainger focuses on creating opportunities for team member growth, development and training, including offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout a team member’s career. This talent program is comprised of performance 9 management, career management, professional development learning opportunities and milestone leadership development programs.\nCompensation and Benefits Grainger believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate team members. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the diverse needs of team members and support their physical and mental health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Team members are given access to health plan resources which include 24-hour virtual health services, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs with access to online support communities. In addition, Grainger provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits as well as a variety of other programs.\nAvailable Information Grainger's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The risks included below are not exhaustive. As Grainger operates in a rapidly changing environment, it is not possible for management to predict all risks and the corresponding impact of each such risk or a combination of risks. The presented risks and any new risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which Grainger is exposed.\nIndustry and Market Risks Inflation could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings.\nMarket variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events, could negatively impact Grainger's ability to effectively manage its operating and administrative expenses. For example, geopolitical conflicts and related international responses have and may continue to exacerbate inflationary pressures, including increases in fuel and other energy costs. In addition, Grainger's inability to pass on increases in costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.\nDisruptions in Grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger’s logistics or supply chain network could be disrupted by the occurrence of: one or more natural or human induced disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather events or conditions; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; disruptions to transportation infrastructure and networks, including from transport providers or third-party work stoppages related to labor strikes or lockouts; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increases in costs associated with international trade. Even when Grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Grainger to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact Grainger's profitability and financial condition. Any of these circumstances could impair Grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to Grainger's reputation. Grainger’s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nFurther escalation of geopolitical tensions across the world and potential actions taken in response to them could have a broad impact on markets where Grainger does business, adversely affect its suppliers and disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of products. It is not possible to predict whether certain geopolitical events which could adversely affect Grainger's business will occur, or the broader consequences of these events if they did occur, which could include further instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy or possible sanctions, embargoes or other trade barriers.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger’s customers could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and industry trends affect Grainger’s business environment. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger’s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, interest rate fluctuations, government spending and government shutdowns, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, work stoppages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger’s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services. 13 Any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Grainger’s pricing and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in Canada, Japan, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger’s sales and results of operations.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with Grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger's products are purchased from more than 5,000 primary suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases. Disruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond Grainger’s control. These factors could include economic downturns, recessions, outbreaks of pandemic disease, natural or human induced disasters, cybersecurity attacks, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, new or increased tariffs, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems or shortages experienced by Grainger’s suppliers or others in the supply chain, transportation availability, staffing and cost, shortage of raw materials, supplier consolidation, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger’s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required, distances involved, and the range of potential consequences of various geopolitical risks. If Grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted, there could be adverse effects on inventory levels, results of operations, customer relationships and Grainger’s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing arrangements which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nFor products sold in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Grainger requires its suppliers and sub-suppliers, to comply with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics, or other similar responsible sourcing standards, as a condition of doing business with Grainger. Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics focuses on four main areas of ethical sourcing: (i) human rights and labor standards (including prohibitions on child and forced labor); (ii) environment, health and safety; (iii) sanctions, trade, bribery and corruption; and (iv) privacy and information security. The Code also addresses how to report potential Code violations and related concerns. Grainger does not control its suppliers and their sub-suppliers, and neither Grainger nor its suppliers or other partners may be able to uncover all instances of noncompliance with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics and ethical and lawful business practices. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, product recalls, or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business. Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture certain products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. The recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. The level of demand for Grainger's products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities, including fuel. Fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services, including as a result of a pandemic, could affect transportation costs. Grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, 14 the Financial Statements of Grainger’s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger’s international subsidiaries, primarily the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi and euro, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency exchange rate is driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors and fiscal decisions of various governments and central banks, all over which Grainger has no control. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect Grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition and other risks could impact demand for Grainger’s products and services.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger’s high-touch operations, eCommerce platforms and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses.\nTo remain competitive, Grainger must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. Downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause Grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. Grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. These pressures could have a material effect on Grainger’s sales and profitability. To manage these potential pressures, Grainger continuously considers the adoption of new operating initiatives, including new marketing programs, productivity improvements, inventory management and loss prevention initiatives, and other similar strategies. If Grainger is unable to sustain or grow sales, reduce costs, and prevent loss and fraud, among other actions, Grainger's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements, innovations and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. Developing, upgrading, managing or implementing new technologies, business applications, strategies and innovations may require significant investment of resources by Grainger, may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, may increase Grainger's vulnerability to cyber breaches, attacks or intrusions, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.\nThe growth of Grainger’s eCommerce platforms exposes Grainger to additional risks which could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The successful execution of Grainger’s eCommerce growth strategy depends on a number of factors, including Grainger’s investment in its eCommerce platforms, consumer preferences and purchasing trends, and the ability to deliver a seamless procurement experience across digital and also physical retail channels. As its eCommerce platforms have grown in recent years, Grainger has increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing technology information systems, software development and other capabilities to provide simplified customer interactions and to provide high-quality, user-friendly service to its customers and streamline customer interactions. Grainger has also made significant investments in digital advertising and customer acquisition and retention efforts for its eCommerce channels, including through paid and non-paid advertising such as display advertising, search engine optimization, email and mobile “push” notifications. If Grainger’s customer-facing technology systems are perceived as more difficult or less compelling for customers to use than those of Grainger’s competitors, or if digital marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these investments, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, Grainger faces many risks and uncertainties beyond the Company's control, including theft, credit card fraud, and other fraudulent behavior. 15 Grainger has also increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and large language model technologies. While the use of these technologies can present significant benefits to Grainger, it also creates risks and challenges. Further, if these investments in Grainger’s eCommerce platforms are less successful at attracting and retaining customers than similar investments by our competitors, or if Grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these technological investments generally, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the successful operation of Grainger’s eCommerce channels depends in part upon third parties and factors over which Grainger has limited or no control. For example, Grainger relies in part on Internet search engines to drive traffic to its websites, and the reach of Grainger’s eCommerce channels is impacted by how and where its websites rank in both paid and unpaid search results. Potential changes to search engine ranking rules could cause Grainger’s websites to place lower in search results and cause Grainger to incur increased advertising costs in order to increase its visibility. Further, ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy, online tracking technologies such as cookies, digital advertising and other eCommerce matters could require Grainger to modify its eCommerce strategy, incur significant additional costs to comply with such changes or otherwise adversely affect Grainger’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Grainger also relies on email and other messaging services to promote its websites and product offerings, and changes in Grainger’s current or prospective customers’ use of email or other messaging services or actions by third parties to block, restrict or charge for the delivery of such messages could adversely affect sales through Grainger’s eCommerce channels and Grainger’s results of operations.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger’s revenue or gross margin, or affect Grainger’s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in its customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions and divestitures, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of eCommerce by Grainger and its competitors.\nIn addition, Grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. If Grainger is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with GPOs, Grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs its customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into Grainger’s existing assortment could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger’s competitive position. The inclusion of Grainger-branded products in the product assortment could subject Grainger to increased claims and litigation activity. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights, including against the manufacturer of such products, may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures.\nGrainger’s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading prices and volumes of Grainger’s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger’s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, Grainger’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchases or dividends, economic decline, political unrest or geopolitical conflict, outbreak of pandemic disease, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A. These factors, many of which are outside of Grainger’s control, could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or Grainger’s stock price to decline. Volatility in the price of Grainger's securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nGrainger has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). MonotaRO's disclosure and reporting obligations under TSE listing requirements and Japanese securities laws, including the timing of such obligations, may vary from Grainger's obligations under New York Stock Exchange 16 listing requirements and U.S. securities laws. MonotaRO's listed securities may be subject to the same volatility, price and securities litigation risks to which Grainger's common stock is subject.\nOperational Risks Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.\nThe functioning of Grainger’s information systems is critical to the operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures to effectively manage its information systems. However, Grainger may not be able to maintain or update its information systems to capture and use data in ways that result in operational efficiency, including as a result of ineffective software, difficulties obtaining the right talent and ability to manage the increasing volume of data available to, and managed by Grainger. Furthermore, although Grainger’s information systems are protected with backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third-party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. In addition, Grainger relies on the information technology (IT) systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.\nThe implementation of new systems and upgrades to existing systems could impact Grainger's operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management's time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, Grainger's systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other IT disruption could have an adverse effect on its business.\nIf Grainger’s systems or those of third parties on which Grainger depends are damaged, breached, cease to function properly or are otherwise disrupted, Grainger may require a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interim interruptions in its business operations. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, Grainger’s ability to operate its eCommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store team member or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger’s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations. Grainger has experienced these incidents in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage Grainger’s reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nThrough Grainger’s sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on Grainger’s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with Grainger. Moreover, Grainger’s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and team member, and other sensitive matters.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in Grainger's information systems. Loss of customer, supplier, and team member information, intellectual property or other business information, or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could, for example, disrupt operations, damage Grainger’s reputation and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Grainger, including its financial condition and results of operations. If successful, cyber-attacks may expose Grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations. The transition in recent years to remote and “hybrid” working arrangements may increase Grainger’s vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage Grainger’s reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose Grainger to claims or other actions from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others. 17 Grainger's IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers, vendors and other third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information. Moreover, Grainger shares information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business. Although Grainger performs risk assessments on third parties where appropriate to learn about their security program, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. Moreover, Grainger may face threats to its information systems, for example, unauthorized access, business email compromise, viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, and organized cyber-attacks. If successful, those attempting to penetrate Grainger’s or its vendors’ information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, team member or business information, or cause systems disruption. While many of Grainger's agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions, Grainger may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur.\nIn addition, a Grainger team member, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures or otherwise access Grainger’s information. Grainger’s systems are integrated with customer systems and a breach of Grainger's systems could be used as an attempt to gain illicit access to customer systems and information. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. There can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to Grainger's business, operations or financial condition. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until they are launched against a target. Grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventative measures. Any breach of Grainger’s security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third-party service providers could cause Grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, team members and other parties whose information is compromised. Such a breach could also cause Grainger to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. Although Grainger maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks, depending on the nature, location and extent of any event, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nGrainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents and in each instance Grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. None of these incidents have been deemed to be material to Grainger and Grainger has neither incurred any material net expenses nor been materially penalized or subject to any material settlement amounts with respect to such incidents in the last three years. However, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to Grainger’s operations and financial condition.\nFor further information regarding Grainger's cybersecurity risk management strategy and the Board's oversight role, see Part I, Item 1C: Cybersecurity of this Form 10-K.\nGrainger’s eCommerce channels are subject to risks related to online payment methods and other online transactions, including through purchasing platforms.\nGrainger accepts a variety of payment methods via its eCommerce channels, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and other payment methods and other online transactions, including through its eProcurement technologies which communicate directly with Grainger.com and Grainger's other eCommerce channels. Although Grainger generally relies on third parties to facilitate eCommerce payments and payment processing services, Grainger may become subject to additional compliance requirements and regulations regarding these transactions, and may also suffer losses from online fraudulent transactions on its eCommerce channels. In addition, Grainger must pay certain transaction fees relating to these transactions, which may increase over time and could have an impact on product margin, profitability and operating costs. Grainger’s eCommerce channels may become subject to further rules and regulations, and changes in these rules and regulations, or their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect results of operations.\nGrainger’s inability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. 18 Grainger’s business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of Grainger’s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect Grainger’s rights. In addition, Grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject Grainger to liability, require Grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause Grainger to modify its operations.\nIn order to compete, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop and retain key team members, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nIn order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop, and retain executives and other key team members, including those in managerial, technical, sales, supply chain, technology development and information technology positions. Grainger competes to hire team members at increasingly competitive wage rates and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Qualified individuals needed to fill open positions may be in short supply in some areas. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect Grainger's labor costs. Competition for qualified team members could require Grainger to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of team members. Additionally collective bargaining or unionization of team members could decrease Grainger's operational flexibility and lead to work stoppages or slowdowns. The performance of Grainger’s stock price could impact Grainger’s use of equity-based compensation to attract and retain executives and other key team members. The success of Grainger's team member hiring and retention also depends on Grainger's ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its team members to thrive.\nGenerally, higher wages and benefit costs, competition for diverse talent, and the risk of an increase in team member turnover, could adversely affect Grainger's results of operations. Further, failure to successfully hire executives and key team members or adequately plan for the succession, transition, and assimilation of executive leaders and team members in key roles, or to plan for the loss of executives and key team members, could adversely affect Grainger's business results and financial condition. Grainger’s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger’s reputation.\nOne of the reasons customers choose to do business with Grainger and team members choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. Grainger devotes time and resources to environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation, including programs driving environmental sustainability, ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity, equity and inclusion, and gender equality. These efforts and programs could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement, and Grainger’s actual or perceived failure to execute its ESG programs as planned could adversely affect Grainger’s reputation, business and financial performance. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger’s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business.\nRegulatory, Legal and Tax Risks Grainger is subject to a complex array of laws, regulations and standards globally. Failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation and other regulatory proceedings could adversely affect Grainger's financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nGrainger’s business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., and its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan.\nThe wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each jurisdiction where Grainger operates, include, but are not limited to, advertising, marketing and Internet regulations (including the use of proprietary or third-party “cookies” in connection with Grainger’s eCommerce platforms), anti-bribery and corruption laws, competition and antitrust regulations, data protection (including, because Grainger accepts credit cards, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act and Privacy Rights Act, 19 in Japan, the Act on Protection of Personal Information, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, currency exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export compliance (including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and anti-money laundering regulations), intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to U.S. taxes on international subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. Moreover, Grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties, remediation costs and/or significant legal fees as well as potential damage to Grainger’s reputation. Changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. Furthermore, while Grainger has implemented policies and procedures and provides training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that team members, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or Grainger’s policies. Any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.\nGrainger’s contracts with federal, state and local government entities are subject to various and changing regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. In addition, Grainger’s government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. From time to time, Grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. Violations of these terms, rules, and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. Any such penalties could result in damage to Grainger’s reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect Grainger’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn conducting its business, Grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by Grainger’s products or services.\nGrainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. Grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, environmental or property damage or other commercial disputes, and the types of matters discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The defense of any proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management’s time and attention, and Grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that Grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures. Grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. Grainger's reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. Tax changes could affect Grainger’s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nGrainger’s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of Grainger’s relative overall profitability and the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of Grainger's tax exposures. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two guidelines address the increasing digitization of the global economy, re-allocating taxing rights among countries. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected during 2024. Grainger continues to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods. Based on information to date, Grainger does not expect either the Pillar One or Two proposals to materially impact the Company’s global income tax liability or effective tax rate. 20 Grainger may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations designed to address climate change. The potential impacts of climate change on Grainger’s suppliers, product offerings, operations, facilities and customers are accelerating and uncertain. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change have resulted in, and may continue to result in, more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that have resulted in, and could continue to result in, more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. New laws, regulations and enforcement could strain Grainger’s suppliers and result in increased compliance-related costs, which could result in higher product costs that are passed to Grainger. New or changing environmental laws and regulations could also increase Grainger’s operating costs, including through higher utility and transportation costs, and Grainger is unable to predict the potential impact such laws and regulations could have on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy and product demand, impact Grainger's transportation costs and supply chain network, and could increase Grainger’s operating costs. Natural disasters as a result of climate change at locations where Grainger, its suppliers or customers operate could cause disruptions to Grainger’s operations, which could adversely affect sales and could negatively impact Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If environmental laws, regulations, and other stakeholder requirements impose significant operational restrictions or compliance requirements upon Grainger or its suppliers, products, or customers, or Grainger's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, Grainger's business, capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Changes in Grainger’s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.\nGrainger’s credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial strength and factors outside of Grainger’s control, such as conditions affecting Grainger’s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of Grainger’s securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the Company’s existing credit facilities or on future financings.\nGrainger has incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent Grainger from fulfilling its obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. The Company’s indebtedness could, among other things, limit Grainger’s ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the Company’s financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe agreements governing Grainger’s debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. Grainger’s failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow Grainger’s creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on Grainger’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.\nIn addition, Grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes. Grainger’s ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on, among other things, the Company’s financial condition, prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments None.\nItem 1C: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Grainger has a cybersecurity team that works to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats. The team has implemented processes designed to assess, identify and manage material risks and vulnerabilities to the Company’s security posture, including prioritizing and remediating such risks. The team also works to assess and manage cybersecurity risks by: (i) reviewing cyber risks with senior management, including the Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO); (ii) incorporating cybersecurity in its enterprise risk processes; (iii) establishing regular reviews of cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts, including with the Audit Committee and the Board; and (iv) using third parties as needed for reviews and testing. Grainger regularly identifies its enterprise risks. Grainger’s cybersecurity team reviews and updates its information security strategy and plans to align cybersecurity prioritization with the identified top enterprise risks. Grainger has developed a cybersecurity risk intake process to facilitate the identification of cybersecurity risks, including those related to third-party vendors. Identified risks are tracked by management, and incorporated into mitigation plans. The management team engaged in the cybersecurity risk management process, including the CTO, has risk management backgrounds, certifications, and/or cyber experience in prior professional roles and at Grainger. The team maintains expertise on cyber risk management through third-party consultants, external trainings, and affiliations with relevant organizations. Grainger has been subject to unauthorized access of systems on which certain supplier, customer, and team member information was stored, which have been deemed immaterial to our business and operations individually and in the aggregate. Grainger, or third-party service providers engaged by Grainger, may be subject to other unauthorized access of information systems in the future. There can be no assurance that any future unauthorized access to or breach of these information systems will not be material to Grainger’s business, operations or financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and processes, including with respect to cybersecurity. Both the Board and the Audit Committee regularly review the Company’s risk assessment and management processes and policies and receive regular updates from the Company’s management team members who are responsible for the effectiveness of the Company’s ERM program. As part of its ERM oversight, the Board oversees and regularly reviews the Company’s programs and processes for cybersecurity risks, including the Company’s framework for preventing, detecting, and addressing cybersecurity incidents and identifying emerging risks both broadly and within related industries. The Company’s CTO routinely provides cybersecurity updates to the Audit Committee and information to the Board. The CTO leads an information security team that works to facilitate the protection of the Company’s information and computing assets. 22 Item 2: Properties As of December 31, 2023, Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled approximately 30.4 million square feet.

Grainger, Inc. (Grainger or Company) as it is viewed by the Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in MD&A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nPercentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.\nOverview W.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.\nStrategic Priorities The Company’s continued strategic aspiration for 2024 is to relentlessly expand Grainger’s leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To achieve this, each Grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and MRO market outgrowth. In the High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) segment, businesses are focused on three areas: advantaged MRO solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. In the Endless Assortment segment, businesses are focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. Additionally, all Grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.\nRecent Events Inflationary Cost Environment and Macroeconomic Pressures The global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. These disruptions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, inflation and a potential recession on the Company’s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. As a result of continued inflation, the Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs while also remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company’s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company’s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFor further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 26 Results of Operations In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" The following table is included as an aid to understanding the changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions of dollars). For the Years Ended December 31, % of Net Sales 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 Net sales(1) $ 16,478 $ 15,228 8.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 9,982 9,379 6.4 60.6 61.6 Gross profit 6,496 5,849 11.1 39.4 38.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,931 3,634 8.2 23.8 23.9 Operating earnings 2,565 2,215 15.8 15.6 14.5 Other expense – net 65 69 (5.5) 0.4 0.4 Income tax provision 597 533 12.0 3.6 3.5 Net earnings 1,903 1,613 18.0 11.6 10.6 Less noncontrolling interest 74 66 12.5 0.5 0.4 Net earnings attributable to W.W.

Daily, organic constant currency net sales excludes the results of E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture and excludes the impact on net sales due to year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. There were 254 and 255 sales days in the full year 2023 and 2022, respectively. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see below \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" Net sales of $16,478 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,250 million, or 8%, and on a daily, organic constant currency basis, net sales increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. Both High-Touch Solutions N.A. and the Endless Assortment segments contributed to sales growth in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's net sales, see the Segment Analysis section below.\nGross profit of $6,496 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $647 million, or 11%, and gross profit margin of 39.4% increased 100 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Both segments contributed to margin expansion in 2023. For further discussion on the Company's gross profit, see the Segment Analysis section below. 27 Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $3,931 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $297 million, or 8%. Adjusted SG&A of $3,905 million increased $250 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2022 driven by higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points in 2023. Operating earnings of $2,565 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $350 million, or 16%. Adjusted operating earnings of $2,591 million increased $397 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by increased SG&A consistent with sales growth in 2023. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in 2023. Income tax expense of $597 million and $533 million represents effective tax rates of 23.9% and 24.8% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was positively impacted by increased benefits related to stock compensation in 2023. Diluted earnings per share was $36.23 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $36.67 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 24% compared to $29.66 for the same period in 2022. 28 Non-GAAP Measures Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. Organic net sales results exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and results of certain divested businesses in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture. Adjusted results including adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Business Divestitures In the fourth quarter of 2023, Grainger divested E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. (E&R) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in SG&A. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Grainger divested Cromwell's wholly owned software business in the U.K. and recorded a one-time pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $21 million in SG&A. The Company does not expect these business exits to have a material effect on its future results of operations. 29 The following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, High-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment Total Company(1) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) 2023 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 13,267 8.9 % $ 2,916 4.7 % $ 16,478 8.2 % Daily impact(3) 0.2 0.4 — 0.4 0.3 0.4 Daily net sales 52.4 9.3 11.5 5.1 65.2 8.6 Foreign currency exchange(4) — — 0.6 5.3 0.6 0.9 Business divestiture(5) — 0.1 — — — — Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 52.4 9.4 % $ 12.1 10.4 % $ 65.8 9.5 % 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) 2022 % Change(2) Reported net sales $ 12,182 19.6 % $ 2,787 8.2 % $ 15,228 16.9 % Daily impact(3) (0.2) (0.5) — (0.5) (0.2) (0.4) Daily net sales 47.6 19.1 10.9 7.7 59.5 16.5 Foreign currency exchange(4) 0.1 0.2 1.3 12.4 1.5 2.8 Daily, organic constant currency net sales $ 47.7 19.3 % $ 12.2 20.1 % 61.0 19.3 % (1) Total Company includes Other.

Segment Analysis In this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see above \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" For further segment information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 13,267 $ 12,182 8.9 % Gross profit 5,546 4,951 12.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,212 2,968 8.2 Operating earnings $ 2,334 $ 1,983 17.7 % Net sales of $13,267 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $1,085 million, or 9% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to volume of 5% and price, which includes customer mix, of 4%. Gross profit of $5,546 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $595 million, or 12%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% increased 120 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies in 2023. 32 SG&A of $3,212 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $244 million, or 8%, and adjusted SG&A of $3,186 million increased $218 million, or 7% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll expenses. Adjusted SG&A leverage improved 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022.\nOperating earnings of $2,334 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $351 million, or 18%, and adjusted operating earnings of $2,360 million increased $377 million, or 19% compared to the same period in 2022. Endless Assortment The following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change Net sales $ 2,916 $ 2,787 4.7 % Gross profit 864 817 5.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 631 594 6.2 Operating earnings $ 233 $ 223 4.3 % Net sales of $2,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $129 million, or 5%, and on a daily constant currency basis, increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to sales growth of 10%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise growth at MonotaRO, partially offset by declining sales at Zoro and non-core, consumer-like customers for the segment. Sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.\nGross profit of $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $47 million, or 6%, and gross profit margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by freight efficiencies at MonotaRO partially offset by unfavorable product mix at Zoro in 2023.\nSG&A of $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll and benefit expenses to support the continued growth of the segment in 2023. SG&A leverage decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Operating earnings of $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.\nSources of Liquidity Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and $325 million, respectively. The increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and favorable year-over-year working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher volume of share repurchases. The Company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of December 31, 2023. 33 Cash Flows The following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,031 $ 1,333 Investing activities (422) (263) Financing activities (1,278) (972) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4 (14) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 335 $ 84 Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,031 million and $1,333 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period was due to higher earnings and favorable changes in year-over-year working capital largely driven by sales growth, inventory management and timing of cash receipts and payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $422 million and $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period primarily reflects increased U.S. supply chain investments including capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives, as well as technology enhancements across the Company. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,278 million and $972 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher treasury stock repurchases.\nDebt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. For further information regarding the Company's debt instruments and available financing sources, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 40.1% and 45.9%, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Ratings Grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade. The following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings as of December 31, 2023: Corporate Senior Unsecured Short-term Moody's A2 A2 P1 S&P A+ A+ A1 Uses of Liquidity Internally generated cash flows are the primary source of Grainger's working capital and growth initiatives, including 34 capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWorking Capital Working capital as of December 31, 2023 was $3,078 million, an increase of $214 million compared to $2,864 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to sustained sales growth and inventory management driven by supply chain efficiencies compared to the prior year period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. Capital Expenditures In fiscal 2023, the Company's capital expenditures were $445 million and $256 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital project spending for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $400 and $500 million. This includes continued supply chain capacity expansion and technology enhancements across the Company. With Grainger's strategic plan to expand its distribution network, the Company completed land purchases in Oregon and Texas in the second and fourth quarters of 2023 for construction of approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 square foot distribution centers (DC), respectively.\nShare Repurchases For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for $850 million and $603 million, respectively. Share repurchases are executed at prices the Company determines appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and the Company's financial performance and may be affected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Share repurchases for 2024 are expected to be in the range of $900 and $1,100 million.\nDividends For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Grainger declared and paid $392 million and $370 million, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company's common stock. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations The Company's material cash requirements include the following commitments and other contractual obligations. Debt As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding debt obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,337 million, with $34 million payable within 12 months. Total future interest payments associated with the Company's outstanding debt obligations was $1,729 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations Grainger had purchase obligations of approximately $1,453 million as of December 31, 2023, which includes approximately $1,175 million payable within 12 months. Grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory, uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment and other goods and services. Purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs and are primarily noncancelable.\nLeases The Company has lease arrangements for certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space). As of December 31, 2023, the Company had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $492 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months. 35 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Grainger’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The majority of the Company’s inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. The Company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. If business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. For further information on the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nContingencies and Legal Matters The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. For further information on the Company's contingencies and legal matters, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 36 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Grainger's primary market risk exposures is as follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Grainger’s financial results, including the value of assets and liabilities, are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units outside the U.S., as stated in their local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 18% of the Company's net sales were denominated in a currency other than the Company's functional U.S. dollar currency. Consequently, the Company is exposed to the impact of exchange rate volatility primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nInterest Rate Risks Grainger is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt. In February 2020, Grainger entered into certain derivative instrument agreements to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt to manage this risk. The annualized effect of a hypothetical 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on Grainger’s variable-rate debt obligations would not materially impact the Company's net earnings for 2023.\nFor debt and derivative instrument information, see Note 5 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risks Grainger’s transportation costs are exposed to fluctuations in the price of fuel and some sourced products contain commodity-priced materials. The Company regularly monitors commodity trends and, as a broad line supplier, mitigates any material exposure to commodity price risk by having alternative sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of supplier concentration, passing commodity-related inflation to customers or suppliers and continuing to scale its distribution networks, including its transportation infrastructure. 37 Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 38 Valuation of Goodwill for the Canadian Reporting Unit Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the goodwill balance of the Canada business reporting unit was $124 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment analysis is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as projections of future operating expenditures, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our audit procedures included, among others obtaining an understanding, evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumption described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Canada business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and involving our valuation specialists to assist in testing the significant assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix, and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 39 W.W.

Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has a controlling ownership interest in MonotaRO, the endless assortment business in Japan, with the residual representing the noncontrolling interest. The Company reports MonotaRO on a one-month calendar lag allowing for the timely preparation of financial statements. This one-month reporting lag is with the exception of significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform with the current year presentation. The Company reclassified amounts to separately disclose Non-cash lease expense as an adjustment to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities and Operating lease liabilities as a change in operating assets and liabilities. Previously, the net activity for these amounts were included in Depreciation and amortization. The change had no effect on previously reported results including net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nForeign Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the Company's reporting currency for all periods presented. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Translation gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive earnings (losses). Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a sales arrangement with a customer exists (e.g., contract, purchase orders, others), the transaction price is fixed or determinable and the Company has satisfied its performance obligation per the sales arrangement. The majority of Company revenue originates from contracts with a single performance obligation to deliver products, whereby performance obligations are satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer per the arranged shipping terms. Some Company contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations and are satisfied when the services are rendered. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for approximately 1% of the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company’s revenue is measured at the determinable transaction price, net of any variable considerations granted to customers and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Variable considerations include rights to return products and sales incentives, which primarily consist of volume rebates. These variable considerations are estimated throughout the year based on various factors, including contract terms, historical experience and performance levels. Total accrued sales returns were approximately $52 million and $38 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as a reduction of Accounts receivable – net. Total accrued sales incentives were approximately $114 million and $102 45 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as part of Accrued expenses.\nThe Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events other than the passage of time. The Company also records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligation. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations, contract assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes the purchase cost of goods sold net of vendor considerations, in-bound shipping costs, outbound shipping and handling costs and service costs. The Company receives vendor considerations, such as rebates to promote their products, which are generally recorded as a reduction to COGS. Rebates earned from vendors that are based on product purchases are capitalized into inventory and rebates earned based on products sold are credited directly to COGS. Total accrued vendor rebates were $155 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported in Trade accounts payable. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) Company SG&A is primarily comprised of payroll and benefits, advertising, depreciation and amortization, lease, indirect purchasing, supply chain and branch operations, technology, and selling expenses, as well as other types of general and administrative costs.\nAdvertising Advertising costs, which include online marketing, are generally expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented or when incurred. Total advertising expense was $638 million, $519 million and $402 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Incentive Plans The Company measures all share-based payments using fair-value-based methods and records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Also, the Company evaluates deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required using a “more likely than not” standard. This assessment considers the nature, frequency and amount of book and taxable income and losses, the duration of statutory carryback and forward periods, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, among other matters.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties to its tax uncertainties in the provision for income taxes.\nOther Comprehensive Earnings (Losses) The Company's Other comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrecognized gains (losses) on postretirement and other employment-related benefit plans. Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) (AOCE) are presented separately as part of shareholders' equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 46 Concentration of Credit Risk The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. Also, the Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries across North America, Japan and U.K. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company’s accounts receivable arises primarily from sales on credit to customers and are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company establishes allowances for credit losses on customer accounts that are potentially uncollectible. These allowances are determined based on several factors, including the age of the receivables, historical collection trends and economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. The allowance is determined by using the loss-rate method, which requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers.\nInventories Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale. The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or market, to account for approximately 77% of total inventory and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, for the remaining inventory. The Company regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and records excess and obsolete provisions representing the difference between excess and obsolete inventories and market value. Estimated market value considers various variables, including product demand, aging and shelf life, market conditions, and liquidation or disposition history and values. If FIFO had been used for all of the Company’s inventories, they would have been $770 million and $693 million higher than reported as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Concurrently, net earnings would have increased by $58 million, $139 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty, Buildings and Equipment Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the asset classes using the straight-line method. Useful lives for buildings, structures and improvements range from 10 to 50 years and furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment from three to 15 years. Amounts expended for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Long-Lived Assets The carrying value of long-lived assets, primarily property, buildings and equipment and amortizable intangibles, is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, are less than their carrying value. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nLeases The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding current and long-term lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. 47 ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement or possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of lease payments is determined using the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate, the ROU asset and the lease liability are re-evaluated upon a lease modification.\nCertain lease agreements include variable lease payments that primarily include payments for non-lease components including pass-through operating expenses such as certain maintenance costs and utilities, and payments for non-components such as real estate taxes and insurance. Lease agreements with fixed lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. Certain of the Company’s lease arrangements contain renewal provisions from one to 30 years, exercisable at the Company's option. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company’s operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in SG&A.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets In a business acquisition, the Company recognizes goodwill as the excess purchase price of an acquired reporting unit over the net amount assigned to assets acquired including intangible assets and liabilities assumed. Acquired intangibles include both assets with indefinite lives and assets that are subject to amortization, which are amortized straight-line over their estimated useful lives. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The Company performs qualitative assessments of significant events and circumstances, such as reporting units' historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, strategic initiatives and overall economic factors to determine the existence of impairment indicators and assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value that would necessitate a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative test, Grainger compares the carrying value of the reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset with its fair value. Any excess of the carrying value over fair value is recorded as an impairment charge, presented as part of SG&A.\nThe fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. Estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units’ future expected cash flows and terminal value.\nThe Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset. The key assumptions when valuing a trade name are the revenue base, the royalty rate and the discount rate.\nAdditionally, the Company capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development of internal-use software, which are presented as intangible assets. Amortization of capitalized software is on a straight-line basis over three or five years.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Company uses statistical methods and qualitative comparisons of critical terms. The extent to which a derivative has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item is assessed and 48 documented periodically. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company classifies them as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.\nContingencies The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is both probable and estimable. If the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded, but the loss contingency and the reasons to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed. If a loss is reasonably possible, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. For further discussion on the Company's contingencies, see Note 14. New Accounting Standards Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This update requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with the option to early adopt prior to the effective date and requires application on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the impact of the requirements on the related segment reporting disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This update requires public entities to disclose consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with the option to early adopt prior to the effective date and should be applied on prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the requirements on the related income tax disclosures. 49 NOTE 2 - REVENUE The Company's revenue is primarily comprised of MRO product sales and related activities, such as freight and services.\nGrainger serves a large number of customers in diverse industries, which are subject to different economic and market-specific factors. The Company's presentation of revenue by segment and industry most reasonably depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic and market-specific factors. In addition, the segments have unique underlying risks associated with customer purchasing behaviors. In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, more than two-thirds of revenue is derived from customer contracts whereas in the Endless Assortment segment, a majority of revenue is derived from non-contractual purchases.\nThe following table presents the Company's percentage of revenue by reportable segment and by major customer industry: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022(1) 2021(1) High-Touch Solutions N.A.

Other accounts for approximately 1%, 2% and 2% of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(3) Other primarily includes revenue from industries and customers that are not material individually, including hospitality, restaurants, property management and natural resources. 50 NOTE 3 - PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT Grainger's property, buildings and equipment consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land and land improvements $ 397 $ 318 Building, structures and improvements 1,469 1,463 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 1,852 1,662 Property, buildings and equipment $ 3,718 $ 3,443 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,060 1,982 Property, buildings and equipment – net $ 1,658 $ 1,461 Depreciation expense on property, buildings and equipment was $146 million, $139 million and $123 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 4 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Grainger completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. Based on the results of that testing, the Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts at each respective period.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A. – Canada Business As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Canada business reporting unit had goodwill of $124 million and $121 million, respectively. As part of our annual impairment testing, the Company compared the current results to forecasted expectations of the most recent quantitative analysis, along with analyzing macroeconomic conditions, current industry trends and transactions, and other market data of industry peers. The Company also performed various sensitivities over key assumptions, including projections of future operating expenditures used in the analysis. The Company did not identify any significant events or changes in circumstances that indicated the existence of impairment indicators for its Canada business, and concluded it was more likely than not its fair value exceeded its carrying value.

Grainger may obtain loans in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding $1.25 billion, which may be increased up to $1.875 billion at the request of the Company, subject to obtaining additional commitments and other customary conditions. The primary purpose of the 2023 Credit Facility is to support the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. The 2023 Credit Facility replaced the Company's former $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of February 2020 (2020 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to mature in February 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility was terminated in October 2023.\nThere were no borrowings outstanding under the Company's 2023 Credit Facility and terminated 2020 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Senior Notes In the years 2015-2020, Grainger issued $2.3 billion in unsecured long-term debt (senior notes) primarily to provide flexibility in funding general working capital needs, share repurchases and long-term cash requirements. The senior notes require no principal payments until maturity and interest is paid semi-annually. The Company incurred debt issuance costs related to the senior notes representing underwriting fees and other expenses. These costs were recorded as a contra-liability in Long-term debt and are being amortized over the term of the senior notes using the straight-line method to Interest expense – net. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unamortized costs were $19 million and $21 million, respectively.\nGrainger uses interest rate swaps to manage the risks associated with the 1.85% senior notes. These swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. The resulting carrying value adjustments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in Other in the table above. For further discussion on the Company's hedge accounting policies and derivative instruments, see Note 11.\nTerm Loan In August 2020, MonotaRO entered into a ¥9 billion term loan agreement to fund technology investments and the expansion of its distribution center (DC) network. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the term loan, including current maturities due within one year, was $32 million and $69 million, respectively. The term loan matures in 2024, payable over two equal remaining semi-annual principal installments in 2024 and bears an average interest rate of 0.05%. 53 Fair Value The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior notes was based on available external pricing data and current market rates for similar debt instruments, among other factors, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company's debt instruments include affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary for companies with similar credit ratings and do not contain any financial performance covenants. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries utilize various financing sources for working capital purposes and other operating needs. These financing sources in aggregate were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe scheduled aggregate principal payments required on the Company's indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within the debt arrangements, for the succeeding five years, excluding debt issuance costs and the impact of derivatives, are due as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Payment Amount 2024 $ 34 2025 503 2026 — 2027 — 2028 — Thereafter 1,800 Total $ 2,337 NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company provides various retirement benefits to eligible team members, including contributions to defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and other benefits. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on team member location. Various foreign benefit plans cover team members in accordance with local legal requirements.\nDefined Contribution Plans A majority of the Company's U.S. team members are covered by a retirement savings plan, which provides for an automatic contribution equal to 6% of the eligible team member's total eligible compensation. The total retirement savings plan expense was $85 million, $87 million, and $78 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company sponsors additional defined contribution plans available to certain U.S. and foreign team members for which contributions are made by the Company and participating team members. The expense associated with these defined contribution plans totaled $21 million, $11 million and $16 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPostretirement Healthcare Benefits Plans The Company has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides coverage for certain U.S. team members. Covered team members become eligible for participation when they qualify for retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the Company. 54 The net periodic benefits costs were valued with a measurement date of January 1 for each year and consisted of the following components (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 SG&A Service cost $ 2 $ 4 $ 5 Other (income) expense Interest cost 5 4 3 Expected return on assets (6) (8) (8) Amortization of prior service credit (10) (10) (9) Amortization of unrecognized gains (7) (9) (8) Net periodic benefits $ (16) $ (19) $ (17) Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit asset, which is calculated as of December 31 measurement date, the fair value of plan assets available for benefits and the funded status of the benefit asset follow (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 112 $ 153 Service cost 2 4 Interest cost 5 4 Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Actuarial loss (gains) 2 (40) Benefits paid (10) (12) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 114 $ 112 Plan assets available for benefits at beginning of year $ 162 $ 207 Actual returns on plan assets 18 (36) Plan participants' contributions 3 3 Benefits paid (10) (12) Plan assets available for benefits at end of year 173 162 Noncurrent postretirement benefit asset $ 59 $ 50 The amounts recognized in AOCE consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Prior service credit $ 23 $ 33 Unrecognized gains 79 77 Deferred tax liability (25) (28) Net accumulated gains $ 77 $ 82 The Company has elected to amortize the amount of net unrecognized gains over a period equal to the average remaining service period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits of approximately 10 years for 2023.\nThe postretirement benefit obligation is determined by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models. These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, mortality and cost-sharing between the Company and the retirees. The actuarial loss recognized during the plan year is primarily related to the change in discount rate assumption. 55 The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic benefit costs as of January 1: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.92 % 2.57 % 2.17 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.50 % 6.50 % 5.81 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2030 2026 The following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.73 % 4.92 % 2.57 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets – net of tax 4.04 % 4.04 % 4.04 % Initial healthcare cost trend rate Pre age 65 7.20 % 7.50 % 6.50 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Year ultimate healthcare cost trend rate reached 2033 2033 2030 The Company's investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and seeks to reach a balance allocation between Fixed Income securities and Equities of approximately 65% and 35%, respectively. Current allocations may differ from targeted allocations based on investment results and other timing factors. The plan's assets are stated at fair value, which represents the net asset value of shares held by the plan in the registered investment companies at the quoted market prices (Level 1 input) or at significant other observable inputs (Level 2 input). The plan assets available for benefits consisted of the following as of December 31 (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 Asset class: Level 1 inputs: Mutual funds: Funds – municipal/provincial bonds $ — $ 8 Funds – corporate bonds fund 10 3 Level 2 inputs: Fixed income: Corporate bonds 56 57 Government/municipal bonds 9 12 Equity funds 88 73 Plan assets 163 153 Trust assets 10 9 Plan assets available for benefits $ 173 $ 162 56 The Company forecasts the following benefit payments related to postretirement (which include a projection for expected future team member service) for the next ten years (in millions of dollars): Year Estimated Gross Benefit Payments 2024 $ 9 2025 10 2026 10 2027 9 2028 8 2029-2033 41 Total $ 87 NOTE 7 - LEASES The Company leases certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space) under various arrangements which provide the right to use the underlying asset and require lease payments for the lease term. The Company’s lease portfolio consists mainly of operating leases that expire at various dates through 2037. Information related to operating leases is as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets Operating lease right-of-use $ 429 $ 367 Operating lease liabilities Operating lease liability 71 68 Long-term operating lease liability 381 318 Total operating lease liabilities $ 452 $ 386 As of December 31, 2023 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 7 years Weighted average incremental borrowing rate 2.19 % 1.46 % Cash paid for operating leases $ 88 $ 76 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 161 $ 96 Rent expense was $102 million, $93 million and $74 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $2 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021. 57 The remaining maturity of existing lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions of dollars): Year Operating Leases 2024 $ 87 2025 87 2026 76 2027 66 2028 57 Thereafter 119 Total lease payments 492 Less interest (40) Present value of lease liabilities $ 452 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's finance leases and service contracts with lease arrangements were not material. Finance leases are reported in Property, buildings and equipment – net, and as a short and long-term finance lease liability in Accrued expenses and Other non-current liabilities.\nNOTE 8 - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS The Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to team members and executives, which include restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares and deferred stock units. As of December 31, 2023, there were 1.4 million shares available for grant under the plans. When awards are exercised or settled, shares of the Company’s treasury stock are issued.\nPretax stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A was $62 million, $48 million, and $42 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was primarily comprised of RSUs. Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $34 million, $19 million, and $21 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units The Company awards RSUs to certain team members and executives. RSUs vest generally over periods from one to seven years from issuance. The RSU grant date fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day preceding the date of the grant. RSU expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $43 million, $34 million and $30 million, respectively. The following table summarizes RSU activity (in millions of dollars, except for share and per share amounts): 2023 2022 2021 Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Shares Weighted Average Price Per Share Beginning nonvested units 191,032 $ 409.77 202,321 $ 318.40 317,414 $ 259.67 Issued 81,174 $ 692.02 96,940 $ 520.67 105,866 $ 406.17 Canceled (7,943) $ 512.31 (17,038) $ 345.30 (36,134) $ 274.74 Vested (91,279) $ 384.92 (91,191) $ 336.99 (184,825) $ 276.34 Ending nonvested units 172,984 $ 550.62 191,032 $ 409.77 202,321 $ 318.40 Fair value of shares vested $ 35 $ 31 $ 51 As of December 31, 2023, there was $64 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 2 years. 58 NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The activity related to outstanding common stock and common stock held in treasury was as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Outstanding Common Stock Treasury Stock Outstanding Common Stock Treasury Stock Outstanding Common Stock Treasury Stock Balance at beginning of period 50,256,323 59,402,896 51,220,205 58,439,014 52,524,391 57,134,828 Exercise of stock options 139,189 (139,189) 101,802 (101,802) 188,444 (188,444) Settlement of restricted stock units – net of 32,800, 31,132 and 61,377 shares retained, respectively 83,795 (83,795) 64,649 (64,649) 127,969 (127,969) Settlement of performance share units – net of 18,521, 10,359 and 9,746 shares retained, respectively 28,135 (28,135) 13,890 (13,890) 12,507 (12,507) Purchase of treasury shares (1,190,040) 1,190,040 (1,144,223) 1,144,223 (1,633,106) 1,633,106 Balance at end of period 49,317,402 60,341,817 50,256,323 59,402,896 51,220,205 58,439,014 NOTE 10 - ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS (LOSSES) (AOCE) The components of AOCE consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): Foreign Currency Translation and Other Defined Postretirement Benefit Plan Other Employment-related Benefit Plans Total Foreign Currency Translation Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests AOCE Attributable to W.W.

Grainger currently enters into certain derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge against these risks, and may continue to do so in the future.\nFair Value Hedges The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt. These swaps are treated as fair value hedges and consequently the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense – net. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $450 million and $500 million, respectively.\nThe liability hedged by the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of the hedged item, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments totaled $432 million and $466 million, respectively. The Company's interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of the Company's interest rate swaps were $16 million and $34 million, respectively.\nThe effect of the Company's fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in Interest expense – net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are shown in the following table (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Gain or (loss): Interest rate swaps: Hedged item $ (15) $ 35 Derivatives designated as hedging instrument $ 15 $ (35) Fair Value The estimated fair values of the Company's derivative instruments were based on quoted market forward rates, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy and reflect the present value of the amount that the Company would pay for contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates. 60 NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by geographical area consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 U.S.\n$ 2,211 $ 1,903 $ 1,267 Foreign 289 243 218 Total $ 2,500 $ 2,146 $ 1,485 Income tax expense consisted of the following (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Current income tax expense: U.S. Federal $ 431 $ 374 $ 221 U.S. State 100 77 46 Foreign 81 78 81 Total current 612 529 348 Deferred income tax (benefit) expense (15) 4 23 Total income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 The income tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the net deferred tax asset (liability) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions of dollars): As of December 31, 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses 177 150 U.S. and foreign loss carryforwards 84 62 Accrued employment-related benefits 51 51 Tax credit carryforward 22 26 Other 30 23 Deferred tax assets 364 312 Less valuation allowance (93) (71) Deferred tax assets – net of valuation allowance $ 271 $ 241 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, buildings, equipment and other capital assets (238) (212) Intangibles (58) (64) Inventory (11) (18) Other (11) (11) Deferred tax liabilities (318) (305) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) The net deferred tax asset (liability) is classified as follows: Noncurrent assets $ 10 $ 12 Noncurrent liabilities (foreign) (57) (76) Net deferred tax liability $ (47) $ (64) 61 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $335 million and $248 million, respectively, of gross loss carryforwards related to foreign operations and U.S. transactions. Some of the loss carryforwards may expire at various dates through 2043. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance, which represents a provision for uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards and deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The Company's valuation allowance changed as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ (71) $ (70) Increases primarily related to foreign NOLs (5) (10) Releases primarily related to foreign NOLs 1 1 Foreign exchange rate changes (2) 4 Increase related to U.S. foreign tax credits 3 1 Increase related to capital loss carryforwards (19) — Other changes – net — 3 Balance at end of period $ (93) $ (71) A reconciliation of income tax expense with federal income taxes at the statutory rate follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Federal income tax $ 525 $ 451 $ 312 State income taxes – net of federal income tax benefit 74 64 41 Stock compensation (16) (5) (8) Foreign rate difference 31 26 26 Change in valuation allowance(1) 6 7 7 Other – net (23) (10) (7) Income tax expense $ 597 $ 533 $ 371 Effective tax rate 23.9 % 24.8 % 25.0 % (1) Net of changes in related tax attributes.\nThe decrease to the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by increased tax benefits related to stock compensation. Foreign Undistributed Earnings Estimated gross undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $544 million and $530 million, respectively. The Company considers these undistributed earnings permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and is not recording a deferred tax liability for any foreign withholding taxes on such amounts. If at some future date the Company ceases to be permanently reinvested in its foreign subsidiaries, the Company may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on these undistributed earnings and may need to record a deferred tax liability for any outside basis difference in its investments in its foreign subsidiaries. 62 Tax Uncertainties The Company recognizes in the financial statements a provision for tax uncertainties, resulting from application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions. The changes in the liability for tax uncertainties, excluding interest, are as follows (in millions of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 41 $ 38 $ 39 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 6 4 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 2 — Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) — (1) Reductions due to statute lapse (3) (2) (3) Settlements, audit payments, refunds – net (2) (1) — Balance at end of year $ 42 $ 41 $ 38 The Company classifies the liability for tax uncertainties in deferred income taxes and tax uncertainties. Included in this amount is $5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Any changes in the timing of deductibility of these items would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authorities to an earlier period. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the changes to tax positions were primarily related to the impact of expiring statutes and current year state and local reserves. The Company is regularly subject to examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service. The statute of limitations expired for the Company's 2019 federal tax return while tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open. The Company is also subject to audit by state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Tax years 2012 through 2022 remain subject to state and local audits and 2012 through 2022 remain subject to foreign audits. The amount of liability associated with the Company's tax uncertainties may change within the next 12 months due to the pending audit activity, expiring statutes or tax payments. A reasonable estimate of such change cannot be made. 63 NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions N.A. and Endless Assortment. The remaining businesses, which includes the Company's Cromwell business, are classified as Other to reconcile to consolidated results. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.\nThe Company's corporate costs are allocated to each reportable segment based on benefits received. Additionally, intersegment sales transactions, which are sales between Grainger businesses in separate reportable segments, are eliminated within the segment to present only the impact of sales to external customers. Service fees for intersegment sales are included in each segment's SG&A and are also eliminated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing is a summary of segment results (in millions of dollars): 2023 2022 2021 Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) Net sales Operating earnings (losses) High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 13,267 $ 2,334 $ 12,182 $ 1,983 $ 10,186 $ 1,334 Endless Assortment 2,916 233 2,787 223 2,576 232 Other 295 (2) 259 9 260 (19) Total Company $ 16,478 $ 2,565 $ 15,228 $ 2,215 $ 13,022 $ 1,547 2023 2022 2021 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense: High-Touch Solutions N.A.\n$ 206 $ 168 $ 148 Endless Assortment 63 35 22 Other 8 3 3 Total $ 277 $ 206 $ 173 Depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense presented above includes long-lived assets, capitalized software and ROU assets.

Products are regularly added and removed from the Company's inventory. Accordingly, it would be impractical to provide sales information by product category due to the way the business is managed, and the dynamic nature of the inventory offered, including the evolving list of products stocked and additional products available online but not stocked. Assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker. 64 NOTE 14 - CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS From time to time the Company is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, including claims related to: product liability, safety or compliance; privacy and cybersecurity matters; negligence; contract disputes; environmental issues; unclaimed property; wage and hour laws; intellectual property; advertising and marketing; consumer protection; pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes); employment practices; regulatory compliance, including trade and export matters; anti-bribery and corruption; and other matters and actions brought by team members, consumers, competitors, suppliers, customers, governmental entities and other third parties.\nAs previously disclosed, between 2019 and 2021, Grainger, KMCO, LLC (KMCO) and other entities were named as defendants in various personal injury and property damage lawsuits in Harris County, Texas relating to an explosion at a KMCO chemical refinery in Crosby, Texas on April 2, 2019. The Company has since settled several of the personal injury lawsuits, including those alleging the most serious injuries. As previously disclosed, those settlements had no effect on net earnings or cash flows for prior quarters or years. The Company continues to contest the remaining KMCO-related lawsuits. The Company is currently unable to predict the timing, outcome or any estimate of possible loss or range of loss on the KMCO lawsuits. Also, as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local governmental entities, the Company may be subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to contract administration, pricing and product compliance.\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these proceedings and other matters, it believes that their ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nNOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 31, 2024, Grainger's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.86 per share of common stock, payable March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record on February 12, 2024. 65 Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.\nItem 9A: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosures and Controls The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that Grainger's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.\nGrainger's management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment under that framework and the criteria established therein, Grainger's management concluded that Grainger's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to Grainger's internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Grainger's internal control over financial reporting. 66 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of W.W. Grainger, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, W.W Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 22, 2024 67 Item 9B: Other Information None of the Company's directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's quarter ended December 31, 2023.

On one end of the spectrum are small distributors who offer local service but limited technology and geographic reach. On the other end are large suppliers with strong eCommerce platforms and national reach but limited local service. In this landscape, Fastenal stands apart in our ability to support customers with local service, comprehensive technology, and consistent capabilities on a global scale.\nThe goal is to help organizations reduce cost, risk, and growth constraints in their supply chains. The result: an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership for products purchased from Fastenal by an average of 21.2% (learn more on pg. 8).\nThese Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) programs represented 40.3% of total sales in 2023.\n95% of total revenue comes from customers utilizing more than one of our sales channels and tools, with 74% of total revenue coming from customers utilizing four or more.(3) Our local team operates in 3,419 in-market selling locations across 25 countries.\n64% of our $1.5B in inventory is staged locally or within customer sites for same-day access.\n1,597 public branches 1,822 Onsite locations Our local service is enhanced by a variety of technology solutions.\n56.1% of our total revenue flows through this “Digital Footprint.”(1) 113,138 weighted FASTBin/ FASTVend installations (MEUs(2)) MOVING FORWARD IN OUR ESG JOURNEY In the latter part of 2022, we achieved third-party certification to the ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management standard, the ISO/IEC 27001 information security management standard, and the ISO 14001 environmental management standard – all reflecting our core commitment to being a safe, secure, and sustainable organization.\nHaving completed an ESG materiality assessment in late 2022, we began 2023 by road-mapping our ESG strategy and building out our internal ESG Community of Practice to promote structured cross-departmental collaboration. In Q4 2023, we completed a scope 3 materiality assessment to broaden our understanding of our carbon inventory and guide future efforts to reduce our environmental impact.\nAs a result of our efforts and improved reporting on ESG matters, we received the 2023 Sustainability Award from Business Intelligence Group and made Newsweek’s 2024 list of America’s Greenest Companies. We finished the year by being awarded a silver medal from EcoVadis, signifying that our sustainability performance ranks in the top 25% of all companies in all industries assessed by EcoVadis.\nScan below to learn more about our ESG programs and progress.\nFASTVend™ Providing secure access and usage tracking close to the point of use in a customer’s facility.\nFASTBin™ Point-of-use devices with embedded technology providing a 24/7 sightline to the customer’s current inventory state.\nFASTStock SM Using mobile technology to illuminate inventory and simplify replenishment.\neCommerce Improves the efficiency of procurement/purchasing processes.

We have always operated under the premise there is no façade, and we openly share ourselves (warts included). To that end, we started sharing a section from the Blue Team Report, our internal annual report to employees, several years ago. Page three includes the lead-in letter from the current report.\nThe Fastenal culture could be characterized as a “glass half-full” mindset or, stated more directly, a “group of pragmatic optimists.” One of the goals in writing this year’s letter to employees, and in sharing some insight into our January 2024 earnings call, was to remind us of the work we’ve completed and to use this reminder as a means to shed some of the unneeded baggage that may have come along for the ride. Another goal was simply to reset our view towards our opportunity – a big market in need of a great supply chain partner like Fastenal. Shifting gears to our message to you, our valued shareholders, here are three items which were either noted in the earnings call or are relevant to a discussion about 2023 (and beyond). First, our global footprint has evolved. In 2022, our total international business exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In 2023, our international business in just the Americas exceeded $1 billion for the first time. This business is primarily in Canada and Mexico, and it’s operated with locally grown talent. Our international business outside the Americas continues to progress, and today we think of it as a $200-million business poised for the future.\nAt this size, the depth of employee talent is large enough to benefit from an increase in investment. The first step to this increased investment involved splitting our international business into two pieces – Americas (outside the United States) and Eurasia (Europe and Asia). We then elevated two successful international leaders to lead these new business units. Next, we challenged everyone within our supporting infrastructure, which is primarily United States-based, to spend some time traveling internationally and to actively invest more time and attention to helping their “international cousins.” Our international business units represent about 17% of our revenue and should receive at least 17% of our attention. Build for the future!\nSecond, we completed a large-scale multi-year branch optimization initiative in the United States, and to a lesser degree in Canada, which began a decade ago (and which occurred largely unnoticed). As highlighted in our January 2024 earnings call, our United States and Canada branch network peaked in 2013 at just over 2,600 locations. In 2013 and 2014, we had a slight reduction because we weren’t pushing the team to open branches. During this time, we also gained momentum with the expansion of our Onsite locations (the subset of our business dedicated to one customer versus a local market). There was a separate component of our business also gaining momentum: our industrial vending business (a service channel we now refer to as FASTVend, a subset of Fastenal Managed Inventory, or FMI). Since 2015, our local sales leadership actively contracted their branch network. To assist, we provided our district managers with a 10,000-foot view of the marketplace. (As noted, much of the reduction occurred in the United States. This subset represented about 2,400 of our 2,600 United States and Canadian locations a decade ago.) At our peak United States branch count, we estimate we were within a 30-minute drive of about 95% of the United States manufacturing marketplace. At today’s count of 1,441, we believe we still have 30-minute access to roughly 93.5% of the U.S. manufacturing marketplace (with a similar presence in Canada) based on our prior analysis of a target branch count of 1,450. The contraction lowered our occupancy expense in the field and was a necessary part of our Onsite expansion; however, the work of consolidating and relocating also distracted our local team. It’s nice to have this distraction behind us.\nThe branch optimization initiative was a major undertaking, but we believe the most significant change of the last decade is our expanded Onsite location network. (See the chart on the following page, which was previously provided in our January 2024 earnings call flip book.) The best way to think of our Onsite network is a business model adaptation that enhances our ability to pursue the total addressable market. In full disclosure, the Onsite network encompasses three main variations: (1) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in the customer’s facility, (2) a dedicated business unit with people and inventory primarily placed in a facility located near the customer site, or (3) a dedicated business unit primarily located in the back of an existing Fastenal branch. The latter two types are usually a result of a customer’s lack of space for us in their facility. We prefer option one but will adjust to any of the three.\nThe evolution of our branch and Onsite network unlocks our energy to pursue by freeing up time for greater engagement with our customers. It also allows us to lower our cost structure. The former is about inquiry and customer service, and the latter is about expanding the basket of products (or customer needs) available to us based on situational economics. (The operational efficiency of the Onsite model allows us to do and supply things for our customers that traditionally would not have been cost-effective.) Here is an example of the impact based on four of our oldest markets (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois). These four U.S. states represented about 19% of our global revenue in 2007 (our 40th year as a business). From 2007 to 2017, our revenue in this geography had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%, and our pre-tax earnings had a CAGR of 5.6%. In 2023, these four American states represented about 15% of our global revenue; and from 2017 to 2023, this revenue expanded to a CAGR of 8.2%, while our pre-tax earnings expanded to an 8.5% CAGR. Simply put, our local team enhanced our ability to grow in a very mature market by changing their approach. Part of the change involved reducing the number of branch locations in these four states by almost 30% versus a decade ago while expanding the Onsite location count roughly seven-fold. In these four states, our Onsite business grew from about 18% of revenue to about 46%. If we want to be more wonky on the view and look at our six oldest metropolitan markets touching these four states (Minneapolis, Madison, Milwaukee, Omaha, Des Moines, and Chicago), a similar story emerges. The branch count drop is slightly greater than 30%, and the Onsite count expansion is more pronounced, with a greater than 10-fold increase. Similarly, our CAGR for revenue and pre-tax earnings expanded, and the percent of our business operated through an Onsite expanded.\nTHANK YOU For Being a Shareholder of Fastenal Dan Florness President & Chief Executive Officer 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 1 Again, the details are a little wonky, but the point is simple: The Blue Team in these markets challenged the status quo, redefined their approach, and improved an already-great business. I believe this enhances our future potential in every market in which we operate. Time will demonstrate if this belief is correct.\nThe third and final item is our operating cash flow – i.e., the Net cash provided by operating activities line in our cash flow statement (and the ultimate health of a business’ long-term potential). The improvement to operating cash flow we enjoyed in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in 2023. For background, during 2021 and most of 2022, we dramatically increased our inventory to support our customers in a period plagued by global supply bottlenecks. As conditions started to improve in late 2022, we started to unwind this inventory expansion. Given the cash flow dynamics of a distribution business, this unwind dramatically improved our operating cash flow.\nThis cash belongs to you – thank you for giving us the opportunity to use it over the last several years to support our customers. The cash was sent to you in the form of a supplemental dividend paid in December 2023, the fourth such supplemental dividend in our history. (The other three were explained in greater detail in last year’s letter to shareholders.) Rest assured, this supplemental dividend is a statement about confidence in the business, not about opportunities to invest.\nWe believe our ability to generate cash in the future, and our ability to supplement available cash with debt if needed (given our conservative balance sheet), will allow us to invest in opportunities as we continue our pursuit of Growth Through Customer Service.\nGood luck in 2024, and thank you for your belief in the Blue Team at Fastenal.\nGo Blue!\nDANIEL L.

Come to think of it, Bob Kierlin already did – it’s titled The Power of Fastenal People. It’s an interesting read, and I would highly recommend it. Even if you’ve read it before, a refresher never hurts. To be honest, every employee in Fastenal (me included) would have been well served to have read it in 2022 and in 2023. It would have reminded us how important it is to (1) support each other and (2) stay focused on our common goal. As it turned out, we wavered on both fronts, and as a result, we underperformed in both years.\nIt wasn’t as obvious in 2022. The global economy was mending from the pandemic, supply chains were constrained, and inflation was running hot. Our strength in supply chain really shined through, and we grew well; however, under the surface we knew we were losing something. We started to forget about our priorities and purpose, and we became a bit too focused on ourselves. As 2023 progressed, it became apparent, and then a weaker global marketplace amplified the problem.\nThere’s a quote credited to Winston Churchill from the World War II era, and it goes something like this: “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.” I’m not sure why this quote popped into my head, but it seemed to aptly describe the Blue Team’s approach to 2023. The good news: After some soul searching and structural changes, we’ve progressed from “tried everything else” to “do the right thing,” which for us means refocusing on our core strengths as an organization.\nFastenal has a superpower. I believe the essence of this power can be summarized as our ability to find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. In an era when it’s easy to find differences and separation, we excel at the opposite, and the members of the Blue Team cherish the unique humanness in each other. We also care enough to push each other to learn, to change, and to grow; and this creates a winning culture. Yes, we sometimes drive each other crazy with our speed of change, but that’s okay – our customers like this about us. We harness this superpower every day by remembering some simple truths: 1. Get everyone pursuing a common goal and you can accomplish great things. 2. Understand our obligations to each other.\n3. Goals matter!\nThe first truth is about our desire to deliver great customer service, knowing the market’s reward for this service is growth. As alluded to above, we lost sight of this truth in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, our common goal is serving the customer well. Fortunately, our motto is easy to remember: Growth Through Customer Service.\nThe second truth is understanding our obligations to each other. We directly serve our customers through the local Blue Team in our branch and Onsite network. Everyone else provides the assist by focusing on helping the local Blue Team. This keeps it simple, and we find success together.\nIf you listen to our quarterly earnings calls, you might have been taken aback by the bluntness in our January 18th call. Don’t get me wrong, we provided some context by discussing the weak economy: 14 consecutive months of economic contraction in the manufacturing sector, as indicated by a sub-50 Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), the longest period of contraction since the Great Recession. But we spent more time discussing our poor execution and the steps taken to address the problem.\nOn this and on earlier calls we spoke about some needed course corrections, and about asking some people to step into new roles. We also spoke about the positives – our success with FMI, our celebration of 20 years in China (and my recent visit to the Blue Team there to recognize the milestone), and our upcoming ten-year celebration in India. If the schedule works out, I hope to visit our Blue Team in India later this year.\nSpeaking of new roles, Jeff Watts (who was promoted to chief sales officer in 2023) laid out three simple concepts for 2024 when he spoke at our recent Employee Expo: (1) Alignment – working together toward a common goal, (2) Accountability – embracing a culture of ownership, and (3) Execution – translating plans into action. The concepts are simple and direct.\nAs we move into 2024, I’m excited by what I see: We are focused on our strength: driving planned/managed spend. We are acknowledging and addressing our deficiencies: improving our capabilities around unplanned/unmanaged spend. This includes addressing weakness in our eCommerce capabilities and creating PO automation to simplify daily processes. We’re also improving our knowledge capabilities (i.e., IT/data capabilities) to view our business through a holistic “customer” lens versus an individual “account” lens. We have a clear sales focus: Target 5, Onsite growth, FMI, and the Customer Solutions Consultant (CSC) program. We’ve also simplified the language we use to describe our diverse customer base: “contract” and “non-contract” customers.\nEarlier I mentioned a recent trip to China (so recent I’m still experiencing a bit of jet lag). There were many highlights from the trip – meeting the team in person, seeing their facilities and how they support their local customers and their Blue Team cousins across the globe, spending time with a long-term supplier. However, what stood out to me is the number of people recognized for five, ten, fifteen, and twenty years of service. We are still a very young organization in China, and it’s amazing how many people have decided to make Fastenal a career.\nAs always, good luck in 2024 … and GO BLUE!\nDANIEL L.

Our management uses free cash flow as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business, as we believe it provides our management and our investors a meaningful evaluation of our liquidity.\n(4) Reflects the impact of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases, adopted January 1, 2019. Financial Highlights 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 5 As of January 19, 2024, there were approximately 900 record holders of our common stock, which includes nominees or broker dealers holding stock on behalf of an estimated 662,000 beneficial owners.\nIn 2023 and 2022, we paid dividends per share totaling $1.78 and $1.24, respectively. This included a special dividend of $0.38 per share paid in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. On January 17, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share to be paid on February 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2024. Our board of directors intends to continue paying quarterly dividends; however, any future determination as to payment of dividends will depend upon the financial condition and results of operations of the company and such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of directors.\nIn 2023, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $47.58 per share.\nThe following chart displays the daily closing sales price of our shares listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the last two years.\n2022 Nasdaq: FAST 2023 (1) Gross cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Approximately 36 years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split eight times, had become 192,000 shares worth $12,435,840, for a gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $2,285,664 in dividends since August 20, 1987, for a total gain of approximately 22.8% compounded annually.\nTen Years On December 31, 2013, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $47,500. Ten years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 10.6% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $18,960 in dividends since December 2013, for a total gain of approximately 12.1% compounded annually.\nFive Years On December 31, 2018, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $52,300. Five years later, on December 31, 2023, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $129,540, for a gain of approximately 19.9% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $12,820 in dividends since December 2018, for a total gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually.\nDividends We have paid dividends in every year since 1991, and quarterly dividends since 2011. In addition, Fastenal paid a special one-time dividend during December 2023, 2020, 2012, and 2008.\nA Simple Philosophy Since going public in 1987, we have maintained a consistent focus on avoiding, if feasible, the potentially dilutive impact of our activities on our shareholders. To this end, we have grown our organization principally with internal cash flow, have supported the Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan with stock purchased in the open market, and, since creating a stock option program in 2003, have periodically purchased common stock in the open market to, among other things, offset the potential impact of our stock option grants. We have purchased approximately 54.4 million shares since 2003 and have granted our employees options to purchase approximately 32.4 million shares. (Note: These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of stock splits.) This has allowed us to balance internal investment with cash returns to shareholders. For example, in the last five years we have enjoyed total sales of $31,319 million and total pre-tax earnings of $6,346 million. During this same time period, we spent approximately $5,636 million to compensate a group of great employees, we supported our customers’ needs by adding approximately $617 million in operational working capital assets (accounts receivable, net, plus inventory) and by spending approximately $869 million in net capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds of sales), and we returned $3,964 million to our shareholders. The latter was principally through dividends (approximately $3,674 million), with the remainder through share purchases. A final point worth noting: We are an important element of the tax base in the many communities in which we operate. During the last five years, we have incurred approximately $1,529 million in income taxes, or approximately 24.1% of the pre-tax earnings noted above, and incurred or remitted approximately $1,465 million in employment taxes, $68 million in property taxes, $1,023 million in sales, use, and value-added taxes, and $5 million in other miscellaneous business-related taxes. This adds up to a total of approximately $4.1 billion in taxes funded in our communities.\n1,000 shares ($9,000) invested on August 20, 1987 Value on December 31, 2023: $12,435,840 Stock Split Stock Performance Highlights (1), (2) 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 7 CREATING VALUE AND MEASURING THE IMPACT Average TCO Savings Opportunity* This is the high-level finding of a study of 445 vetted TCO Analysis exercises.\nBelow is a look at some of the drivers behind this headline number.\n21.2% 39% average reduction in inventory carrying cost 61% average reduction in cost associated with material handling/distribution 32% average reduction in transportation cost 56% average vendor reduction 36% average reduction in employee travel time 47% average reduction in the cost to source products 20% average consumption reduction through vending Accepted industry average (not based on our internal study) Fastenal’s solution-based approach stems from a simple truth: Every minute or dollar our customers spend procuring, managing, owning, or accessing supplies is a minute or dollar they aren’t spending on value-creating activities. Our job is to help them minimize those sources of waste, and it often starts with a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis. This includes (1) mapping how products are procured, moved, staged, and used in their facilities; (2) quantifying the costs surrounding those activities; and (3) presenting a tailored set of solutions to help them achieve specific TCO reduction goals for the products in scope. * This average TCO savings opportunity is based on an assumption of the customers’ full adoption of our suggested services and solutions. Vetted opportunities meet the following criteria: (1) the conductor of the TCO Analysis (a trained Fastenal Lean Six Sigma specialist) has confirmed the validity of the data entered; (2) 70% or more of the TCO Analysis data is customer-specific, not based on industry averages; and (3) the data was accepted/agreed upon by the customer during or after the TCO Analysis presentation.\nThe takeaway: By helping customers operate more efficiently and productively, our role is elevated from “supplier of products” to “strategic partner in the business.” This focus on value creation and documentation allows us to build exceptionally strong relationships, maintain resilient revenue streams, and widen our competitive moat.\n8 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 10-K (Mark One) ☒ Annual report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or ☐ Transition report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 For the transition period from to Commission file number 0-16125 FASTENAL COMPANY (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Minnesota 41-0948415 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization) (I.R.S.

The year end is December 31, 2023 unless additional years are included or noted.\nOverview Fastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as 'Fastenal' or the company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population today of approximately 26,000. We began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small, medium, and, in subsequent years, large cities. Over time, how and where we engage our customers has expanded and evolved. Today we sell a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines through a global network of in-market locations utilizing diverse technologies such as vending devices, bin stock devices, and eCommerce. The large majority of our transactions are business-to-business. We provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document. At the end of 2023, we had 3,419 in-market locations (defined in the table below) in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in North America (12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico), and two in Europe, and we employed 23,201 people. We believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers, and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement.\nOur Channels to Market We engage our customers primarily through branch and Onsite locations. Branches and Onsites exist very close to our customers, usually within miles in the case of the former and most often within or immediately proximate to our customers' physical locations in the case of the latter, and together constitute our 'in-market' network. Many of our customers engage with us through eCommerce, but in most cases these customers are utilizing eCommerce to supplement our service through our other channels.\nThe following table shows, as of the end of each of the last 10 fiscal years, our consolidated net sales; the number of branch, Onsite, and total in-market locations; their respective sales, as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and Onsite locations; and our revenue generated from non-traditional sources: 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 6,010.9 5,647.3 5,333.7 4,965.1 4,390.5 3,962.0 3,869.2 3,733.5 Branch locations 1,597 1,683 1,793 2,003 2,114 2,227 2,383 2,503 2,622 2,637 Branch revenue (1) $ 4,073.6 4,161.6 3,726.2 3,587.1 3,660.1 3,625.8 3,399.6 3,198.1 3,281.8 3,225.3 Average monthly sales per branch location (2) $ 207.0 199.5 163.6 145.2 140.5 131.1 116.0 104.0 104.0 101.0 Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 1,416 1,265 1,114 894 605 401 264 214 Onsite revenue (1) $ 2,926.7 2,465.5 1,898.0 1,485.6 1,391.7 1,081.7 770.2 569.2 454.3 387.7 Average monthly sales per Onsite location (2) $ 141.6 135.2 118.0 104.1 115.5 120.3 127.6 142.7 158.4 157.6 Other revenue (3) $ 346.4 353.5 386.7 574.6 281.9 257.6 220.7 194.7 133.1 120.5 Total in-market locations (4) 3,419 3,306 3,209 3,268 3,228 3,121 2,988 2,904 2,886 2,851 (1) Revenues attributable to our traditional and international branch locations (both of which are defined below), and our Onsite locations, respectively.\n(2) Average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and Onsites, respectively, in the given year, factoring in the beginning and ending location count, divided by total revenues attributable to our branch and Onsite locations, respectively, further divided by 12 months. This information is presented in thousands.\n(3) This portion of revenue is generated outside our traditional in-market locations, examples of which include revenues arising from our custom in-house manufacturing, industrial services, and other non-traditional sources of revenue. In 2020, this included the effects of COVID-19, one response to which was substantial sales of pandemic-related products that were direct-shipped (versus sold through in-market locations) as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly.\n(4) 'In-market locations' is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of Onsite locations.\n2 This structure has evolved over time as a result of one of Fastenal's guiding principles since inception: that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer. This has been achieved by opening branch locations and, more recently, Onsite locations. Today, we believe there are few companies that offer our North American in-market location coverage. In 2023, roughly 52% of our sales and 51% of our in-market locations were in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (populations in the United States and Canada greater than 500,000 people), while 21% of our sales and 19% of our in-market locations were in small MSAs (populations under 500,000 people), and 27% of our sales and 30% of our in-market locations were not in an MSA. In our view, this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis. Maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers' operations have represented, and continue to represent, the foundation of our service approach. We have two primary versions of our branch locations: 1) A 'traditional branch' typically services a wide variety of customers, ranging from the local operations of large, national account customers to smaller local businesses. Based on the unique characteristics of certain markets, some traditional branches will be structured and stocked to service retail customers. Locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network and employment and production data for manufacturing and non-residential construction companies. We stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and tailored by our district and branch personnel to the needs of the local customer base. Since Fastenal's founding and through 2013, traditional branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company, and we experienced net openings each year over that time span. However, new growth drivers, business models, and business tools have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth. Traditional branches were entirely U.S.-based until 1994, when we opened our first location in Canada. At the end of 2023, we had 1,441 traditional branches in the United States and Canada, and they represented 51.0% of net sales.\nTraditional branches are also differentiated by their operating styles. Certain locations are Customer Service Branches (CSBs), which tend to feature a showroom and our standard stocking model of products designed for contractors. CSBs often conduct some business with non-account or retail-like customers. However, this customer set typically represents less than 10% of sales at this type of location. Other locations operate as Customer Fulfillment Centers (CFCs), which tend to feature a limited showroom and stock customer-specific inventory. These tend to appear and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location and often have fewer transactions with non-account or retail-like customers than in a CSB branch. The choice of operating style is made by local leadership and is based on local market considerations. At the end of 2023, 15% of our traditional branches operated as a CSB and 85% operated as a CFC.\n2) An 'international branch' is the format we typically deploy outside the United States and Canada. We first expanded outside of the United States and Canada when we opened a branch in Mexico in 2001. Since then, we have continued to expand our global footprint, and at the end of 2023, we operated in 23 countries outside of the United States and Canada. Mexico is the largest of these, and we also operate in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Our go-to-market strategy in countries outside of the United States and Canada focuses primarily on servicing large, national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing and heavily oriented toward planned fastener and non-fastener product spend. We are not as well recognized in many of our non-North American locations as we are in the U.S. and Canada. However, our ability to provide a consistent service model, including vending, bin stocks, and Onsites, on a global basis is attractive to our customer base, much of which are the foreign operations of North American-based companies. At the end of 2023, we had 156 international branches operating outside the U.S. and Canada, and they represented 4.5% of net sales.\nTraditional and international branches sell to multiple customers. In each year since 2013, we have experienced a net decline in our total branch count, primarily due to consolidations in our U.S. market, including net declines of 86 branches in 2023. Our total decline since 2013 is 1,090 branches. We will continue to open traditional and international branches in accordance with our overall strategy. We believe the strategic rationalization that has produced a significant decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. Onsite locations may influence the trend in our traditional branch count over time, but have not been the primary reason for our traditional branch closings. The Onsite concept is not new, in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992. However, it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014. We have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015. In this model, we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within, or strategically proximate to, the customers' facility, with inventory that is specific to the customers' needs. In many cases, we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch location, though we also see new customer opportunities arise as a result of our Onsite capabilities. The model is best suited for larger companies, though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors. It has been our experience that the sales mix at our Onsite locations typically produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations, but we gain revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is lower. We have identified over 12,000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in North America with potential to implement the Onsite service model. These include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today, and 3 potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today. However, as awareness of our capabilities has grown, we have identified additional Onsite potential with certain agencies of state, provincial, and local government customers, and academia. We also believe as we follow our existing national account customers outside the United States, our market potential for Onsite solutions will continue to expand. The international opportunity is substantial, but our speed is limited by our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the United States. We expect revenues from Onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time. We had 1,822 Onsite locations as of December 31, 2023, which represented 39.8% of net sales, and signed 326, 356, and 274 new Onsite locations (referred to herein as signings) in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the branches and Onsite locations we operated at the end of each year, as well as the openings, closings, and conversions during each year: North America Outside North America United States (1) Canada Mexico Subtotal Central & South America (2) Asia (3) Europe (4) Subtotal Total In-Market Locations - 12/31/21 (5) 2,668 262 152 3,082 20 37 70 127 3,209 Starting Branches 1,484 173 63 1,720 5 20 48 73 1,793 Opened Branches — 1 4 5 — 2 5 7 12 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (115) (5) (1) (121) — — (1) (1) (122) Ending Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Starting Onsites 1,184 89 89 1,362 15 17 22 54 1,416 Opened Onsites 248 21 23 292 1 6 7 14 306 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (94) (3) (1) (98) — — (1) (1) (99) Ending Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 In-Market Locations - 12/31/22 2,707 276 177 3,160 21 45 80 146 3,306 Starting Branches 1,369 169 66 1,604 5 22 52 79 1,683 Opened Branches — — 3 3 — 3 4 7 10 Closed/Converted Branches (6) (92) (5) — (97) — — 1 1 (96) Ending Branches 1,277 164 69 1,510 5 25 57 87 1,597 Starting Onsites 1,338 107 111 1,556 16 23 28 67 1,623 Opened Onsites 283 18 20 321 — 1 7 8 329 Closed/Converted Onsites (6) (115) (6) (3) (124) (1) (2) (3) (6) (130) Ending Onsites 1,506 119 128 1,753 15 22 32 69 1,822 In-Market Locations - 12/31/23 2,783 283 197 3,263 20 47 89 156 3,419 (1) Includes the United States, the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n(2) Includes Panama, Brazil, and Chile.\n(3) Includes Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n(4) Includes the Netherlands, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, France, and Belgium.\n(5) Beginning in 2022, the United States includes the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico which were previously grouped with other geographical regions. Prior period figures in the above table may differ slightly from those previously disclosed due to this minor change in reporting. (6) The net impact of non-in-market locations or Onsite locations converted to branches, branches converted to Onsite locations or non-in-market locations, and closures of branches or Onsite locations.\nWe believe the profitability of our in-market locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site. In any in-market location, certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable, such as employee-related expenses, while others, like rent and utility costs, tend to be fixed. As a result, it has been shown that as an in-market location increases its sales base over time, it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin. This ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by: (1) general growth based on end market expansion and/or market share gains, (2) the age of the in-market location (new locations tend to be less profitable due to start-up costs and, in the case of a traditional branch, the time necessary to generate a customer base), and/or (3) rationalization actions, as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional 4 branch base. There are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location. Key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market, factories may have closed, our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches, and/or our customers may have transitioned to our Onsite model. An Onsite location may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise, in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local traditional branch. The paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an Onsite location, as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage, while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employee-related expenses. In the short term, the Onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged.\nWe utilize additional types of selling locations within our network, but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number, comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations. We remain committed to a large, robust service network, including traditional branches, international branches, and Onsites; it remains the indispensable foundation of our business. With the growth we anticipate in Onsite locations, we believe our total in-market locations will increase further over time.\nOur Business Tools Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®) Over time, we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location, increase the visibility of a customer's supply chain (to the customer as well as our personnel), and/or improve the ability to monitor or control usage. While there are isolated exceptions, these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and Onsite channels to enhance service to our customers. Collectively, these tools comprise our Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) Technology suite. We believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers. FMI programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and, coupled with our fully integrated distribution network, foster a strong relationship with customers.\nBin stock (FASTStock℠ and FASTBin®) programs, where product is held in bins in a customer facility, are similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities. Such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time, with open bins being clustered in a racking system, each of which holds original equipment manufacturing (OEM) fasteners, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) fasteners, and/ or non-fastener products that are consumed in the customers' operations. Historically, these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or Fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need. These bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customized digital plan-o-grams, which we call FASTStock and allow for the scanning of product when it is at a minimum desired level. However, in 2019 we introduced our FASTBin technology. FASTBin is the evolution of FASTStock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 24/7 continuous inventory monitoring, real-time inventory visibility, and more efficient replenishment of bin stock parts. These technologies come in three forms: (1) scales that utilize a high-precision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum; (2) infrared (IR) that uses infrared sensors lining individual bins to provide real-time visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum threshold; and (3) RFID, which is a Kanban system that utilizes RFID tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone (also part of the same racking system), a notification is sent to Fastenal to refill the order. These technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes, allowing for a lean supply chain, reducing risk of stock-outs, and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier.\nIndustrial vending (FASTVend®) was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control. Benefits include reduced consumption, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability. We believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive in-market network of inventory and local personnel. For these reasons, the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011, and we finished 2023 with approximately 111,800 FASTVend non-weighted devices in the field. We believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized. We also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base of devices before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support. We estimate the market could support as many as 1.7 million vending units and, as a result, we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time.\n5 Our industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices, with 16 of these being in either a helix or locker format. Our most utilized models include the helix-based FAST 5000 and our 12- and 18-door lockers; combined, these comprise approximately 66% of our installed base of devices. These are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers. Target monthly revenues per device typically range from under $1,000 to in excess of $3,000, with our flagship FAST 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of $2,000. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we began to report a weighted FMI measure which combines the signings and installations of FASTBin and FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We do not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins, shelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. This conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each FMI device signed or installed and compares it to the $2,000 target monthly throughput of our FAST 5000 vending device. For example, an RFID enclosure, with target monthly revenue of $2,000 would be counted as '1.00' machine equivalent ($2,000/$2,000 = 1.00). An infrared bin, with target monthly revenue of $40, would be counted as '0.02' machine equivalent ($40/$2,000 = 0.02).\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Change Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs) 24,126 20,735 16.4% Signings per day 95 82 Weighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period) 113,138 102,151 10.8% FASTStock sales $ 927.6 832.0 11.5% % of sales 12.5% 11.8% FASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 2,070.2 1,755.3 17.9% % of sales 27.8% 24.9% FMI sales $ 2,997.8 2,587.3 15.9% FMI daily sales $ 11.8 10.2 16.3% % of sales 40.3% 36.7% Digital Solutions We also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers, leverage local inventory for same-day solutions, and provide efficient service. While there is a transactional element to our digital services, many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain. These solutions take many forms: 1) Transactional. Our transactional, or eCommerce, platforms (web verticals or integrated catalogs) provide a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure MRO and unplanned spend. While there is a retail component to our transactional digital services, most of the revenue attributable to this is with our traditional customer base, nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools that it utilizes with Fastenal. We attribute the revenue generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the in-market location that traditionally services that customer location. 2) Digital Visibility. Certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves and/or to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chain operations. For instance, we have developed, and continue to develop, 'Mobility' applications, one example of which is our Vending App, which provides a number of benefits. It provides easy, real-time information pertaining to a customer's local inventory position within their point-of-use devices. It incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices, which improves customer inventories while reducing the risk of stock-outs. Moving our fulfillment process from a vending device-based keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process (reduced risk of product outages), reducing time consumed (greater efficiency) while improving accuracy (improved quality assurance). We will continue to build out our suite of Mobility applications. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), is the connectivity between our system and our customers' procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system or through a third-party procurement network or marketplace. These solutions provide a system-to-system exchange of electronic procurement documents (such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices for direct and indirect spend). Our eProcurement Solutions provide a bridge between our FMI replenishment activity and our customers' procurement systems – creating an efficient, accurate and streamlined procure-to-pay (P2P) process. FAST360° acts as the bridge between our FMI footprint and a 6 customer's view into our managed service model. FAST360° surfaces data around these managed services as one central source of information as we manage our customers' OEM and MRO product lines. This is achieved through our FMI technologies providing locational data around our FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend footprint, and FAST360° being the means of surfacing that data and activities to our customers. 3) Analytics. We provide solutions-based digital platforms (e.g., web verticals or integrated catalogs) which leverage our existing strategic environment by creating a means of migrating online spend offline, which illuminates our supply chain capabilities. This is marketed under the FAST360° Analytics label, as it is an enterprise-centric extension of the digital visibility capabilities of FAST360°. We bring value to our customers, as well as ourselves, by using these digital platforms and analytics to shift product from a 'non-sticky' transactional environment (which is online) to a 'sticky' strategic environment (which is our FMI programs). We create customer cost savings opportunities through this directive by lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) as the objective is to shrink the unplanned (and traditionally high cost), purely transactional spend bucket.\nDigital Footprint Our digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that proportion of our eCommerce sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both ourselves and our customers. As a result, we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities. Our Digital Footprint represented 56.1% of sales in 2023.\nWe believe our integrated physical and virtual model, when paired with our national (and increasingly international) scope, represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to eCommerce as an independent sales channel. We expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time. Our greatest opportunity lies with the deployment of efficient and effective supply chain programs. We are focused on addressing the four key components of people, products, processes, and technology to support this model. We believe our global channels to market and business tools, including those that we consider to be growth drivers (Onsites, international expansion, FMI, and digital solutions), represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups. These means get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed. This is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and 'sticky' service. Combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling (in-market and otherwise) and non-selling (engineering, product specialists, manufacturing, etc.) employees, we offer a range of capabilities that are difficult for large and small competitors to replicate.\nDistribution Network We operate 15 regional distribution centers in North America: 12 in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico. We also operate two distribution centers in Europe. These distribution centers give us approximately 5.0 million square feet of distribution capacity. Additional details on these locations can be found within the 'Item 2. Properties' section of this Form 10-K. These distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our in-market locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier, with approximately 74% of our North American in-market locations receiving service four to five times per week. The distribution centers in Indiana and Kansas also serve as 'master' hubs, with those in California and North Carolina serving as 'secondary' hubs to support the needs of the in-market locations in their geographic regions as well as to provide a broader selection of products for the in-market locations serviced by the other distribution centers. We currently operate 11 of our North American distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency, and currently handle approximately 94% of our picking activity. We expect to invest in additional automation technologies, expand existing distribution facilities, and/or add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our in-market locations increases.\n7 We also utilize a network of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) which reside within our existing distribution centers and are intended to support areas that have a dense population of FMI devices. Traditionally, branch personnel were solely responsible for stocking and packaging inventory, delivering to a customer's location, and refilling the customer's devices. As our sales through FMI devices have grown, this approach has resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnel's time being spent on non-sales activities. We primarily utilize a 'drop-and-deliver' model wherein a LIFT is responsible for stocking and packaging FMI supplies, producing inventory and accuracy benefits, and delivering them to the business unit, where delivery and replenishment is then performed by local district or branch personnel. In a minority of cases we deploy a 'drop-and-scatter' model, wherein delivery and replenishment is also performed by LIFT personnel. In 2023, approximately 8% of our FMI revenue was serviced through a LIFT, but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40% of our FMI revenue.\nTransportation The ability to move product, globally and domestically, from our sources of supply to our customers is critical to the competitiveness of our business model. We utilize multiple modes of transportation to support our business model.\nWe transport product from our global manufacturing and supplier partners to our distribution centers. Related costs range from port fees, duties, costs related to container and shipper services, and inland trucking and intermodal charges. We consider these expenses to be a part of our landed product cost, and significant fluctuations are typically addressed through product pricing.\nWe transport product between our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our in-market locations. We typically transport approximately 90% of our products on our own fleet of Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks, with the remainder being on third party shippers. Costs range from lease charges, driver pay, fuel costs to support our captive fleet, and fees paid to third-party shippers. These expenses are included in cost of goods sold but are not considered a part of our landed product cost, with fluctuations typically addressed by applying freight charges to customer purchases and by securing commercial back-hauls. We primarily lease our trucks, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 520 units.\nWe transport product from our in-market locations to our customers on a fleet of pick-up, box, and other trucks. Expenses to maintain this fleet are considered selling-related transportation costs, which include lease charges, depreciation, and fuel, and are typically reflected in all other operating and administrative expenses. We have a mix of leased and owned vehicles, and at December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 10,200 units. Information Systems Our Information Systems teams develop, implement, secure, and maintain the computer-based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, digital, distribution center, and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations, while each selling location uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of custom in-house developed, purchased, and subscription licensed software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.\nTrademarks and Service Marks We conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and taglines in connection with each of these marks, including Where Industry Meets Innovation™. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the 'Fastenal' name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, various trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the United States as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.\nProducts Fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies. This includes threaded fasteners, bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers, as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as pins, machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories. Our fastener product line, which is primarily sold under the Fastenal product name, represented 32.4% of our consolidated sales in 2023. Fastener distribution is complex. In most cases, the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight. This presents challenges in moving product from suppliers, most of whom are outside of North America, to our distribution centers, as well as from our distribution centers to our branch, Onsite, and customer locations. At the same time, fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products, construction projects, and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application. In many cases, a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime and/or effective use. These features have greatly influenced our logistical development, training and educational programs, support capabilities, and inventory decisions, which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate.\n8 In 1993, we began to aggressively add additional product lines, and these represented 67.6% of our consolidated sales in 2023. These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending. The most significant category of non-fastener products is our safety supplies product line, which accounted for 21.2% of our consolidated sales in 2023. This product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last 10 years, which we believe is directly attributable to our success cross-selling safety supplies to customers that utilize us for non-safety products as well as our ability to market, deploy, and service industrial vending over that period. We expect these variables to remain the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line. We plan to continue to add other product lines in the future.\nIn the last several decades, we have added 'private label' brands (often referred to as 'Exclusive Brands', or brands sold exclusively through Fastenal) to our non-fastener offering. Prior to 2023, each of our product categories tended to have its own private label. In 2023, we consolidated these into two labels: Body Guard®, which is our long-standing brand for North American safety supplies, and ORMADUS®, which is our global brand encompassing the remainder of our product offerings. These private label brands represented approximately 13% of our consolidated sales in 2023. We believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 19% of our total non-fastener sales in 2023. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices. Detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K. Each product line may contain multiple product categories. Inventory Control Our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, by our district and regional leadership, and by our product development team. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 64% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 36% of our total inventory at the end of 2023. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations In 2023, approximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome®, Cardinal Fasteners®, and Spensall® product lines. The services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\n9 Sources of Supply We use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. During 2023, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products, our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. Approximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses fabricated products, heavy machinery, petrochemical, mining and aerospace and includes both OEM and MRO customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation (transportation services, such as air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as fulfillment centers) and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other, interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of revenue tends to be impacted by cyclical changes, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nOur national accounts program is aimed at creating contractual agreements with single or multi-location customers. These contractual programs are intended to help improve our customers' supply chains by identifying productivity and efficiency gains throughout their organization. The scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that these companies need to manage is very complex and costly. We believe that our broad product offering coupled with our ability to execute and curate a dedicated service model for each of their sites provides us with a unique advantage and allows us to provide them with a total cost of ownership benefit. Additionally, our local presence as part of a national, and increasingly international, footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. We believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands. As a result, in 2023, national accounts represented 60.3% of our consolidated sales, compared to 57.8% and 56.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales over time. In an in-market location, we track our customers' business activity through 'active accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2023, we averaged 105,448 active accounts per month and approximately 99.4% of the sales in our in-market locations are derived from our active accounts (the remainder was from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers). Traditionally, our in-market locations, particularly our traditional and international branches, prioritized acquiring additional active accounts and expanding the products and services sold to new and existing active accounts as a means of growing sales. Over time it became clear that the pursuit of smaller accounts consumed significant organizational energy and the large majority of new active accounts did not meaningfully increase in size. Further, the development of our web capabilities provided us with an alternative means of more efficiently servicing these smaller customers. Since 2020, our in-market locations have sought to shift our smallest customers to our web channel while shifting 10 their selling focus to 'key accounts', which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key account customers have typically been able to utilize a wider range of our products and services, and as a result have exhibited greater potential to increase in size while being more efficient to pursue and support. In 2023, we averaged 39,266 key accounts per month and approximately 92.4% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Active Accounts 105,448 119,583 130,020 137,380 152,491 156,069 156,464 Key Accounts 39,266 39,151 36,190 33,794 34,621 32,895 30,040 During 2023, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nDirect marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local in-market selling personnel, as well as our non-branch selling personnel. We support our sales team with multi-channel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing, print and radio advertising, targeted campaigns, promotional flyers, and events. In recent years, our national advertising has been focused on a NASCAR® sponsorship through our partnership with Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing® as the primary sponsor of the No. 17 car in the NASCAR® Cup Series, driven by Chris Buescher. In 2020, our sports marketing efforts were extended when the National Hockey League (NHL®) awarded us as the preferred MRO supplier of the sport.\nSeasonality Seasonality has some impact on our sales. The first and fourth quarters of each year are typically our lowest volume periods, given their overlap with winter months in North America during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. The fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the Thanksgiving (October in Canada and November in the United States), Christmas, and New Year holiday periods, due to plant shut downs. In contrast, the second and third quarters of each year typically have higher revenues due to stronger non-residential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays (although Good Friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of July will always fall in the third quarter).\nCompetition Our business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas, and smaller regional or local distributors, which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products, in no particular order, are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.\nMarket strategies in industrial distribution are varied. With respect to products, many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broad-line offering over time; however, they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share. This association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors, though many smaller competitors do deploy a broad-line model. Means of serving the customer are even more diverse. For instance, many competitors maintain a local, branch-based presence in their markets, while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses, while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales. Recent years have seen the emergence of eCommerce solutions, such as websites, and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors, it also has introduced non-traditional web-based competitors into the marketplace. The diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base. The large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels, from a single distributor or a range of distributors, to procure the products they need in their operations.\nWe believe that better service, and a competitive selling advantage, can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers' location(s). As a result, we maintain in-market locations in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products. The convenience of a large number of in-market locations in a given area, combined with our ability to provide them with frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers, facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our FMI solutions, supported by an in-market location, provide a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each in-market location also enhances our ability to compete (see 'Employees' below).\nOur Onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers. Building on our core business strategy of the local branch, the Onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers, all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure.\n11 Human Capital Resources Employees At the end of 2023, we employed 23,201 full- and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 71% held a selling role. We characterize these personnel as follows: 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total Selling personnel (1) 16,512 71.2% 15,898 71.0% Distribution/Transportation personnel 4,042 17.4% 3,974 17.8% Manufacturing personnel 733 3.2% 733 3.3% Organizational support personnel (2) 1,914 8.2% 1,781 8.0% Total personnel 23,201 100.0% 22,386 100.0% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nEmployee Profile As of December 31, 2023, we had 23,201 employees worldwide, with 18,539 of those employees located in the United States (U.S.), 3,038 employees located in Canada and Mexico, and 1,624 employees located overseas in 24 other countries throughout the world. Based on our EEO-1 data for 2023, in the U.S., females and minorities constitute 24.0% and 23.6% of our workforce, respectively. We believe these absolute figures gain further context when viewed against two additional data sets. First, over the past ten years there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business. Since 2013, our female and minority workforces have grown 2.2x and 3.8x faster, respectively, than our overall U.S. workforce. This trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution, including the natural progression of our geographic expansion, the cycle of our promote-from-within philosophy, and efforts to improve hiring processes over time. Second, based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we believe Fastenal's mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction, which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates. For instance, relative to the 24.0% of our U.S. workforce that is female, the proportion of females in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 29.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Similarly, relative to the 23.6% of our U.S. workforce that are minorities, the proportion of non-white (a definition utilized by the U.S. Census Bureau) individuals in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 21.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Health and Safety Employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a multi-faceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Today, our health and safety programs span all operations including manufacturing, distribution centers, fleet and auto, and our branch and Onsite network. These key business units play a dynamic role in defining how we engage with our employees on health and safety. Trainings, audits, inspections, risk assessments, safety coaching, and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility safety and employee safety. In 2023, there were over 214,000 completed health and safety engagements, which is an increase of 7% compared to 2022. Our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance. We continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows.\nThis commitment to, and continuous improvement toward, a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results. A widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the Experience Modification Rate (EMR). An organization's EMR is established through the comparison of a company's past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages, which are compiled by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization. Industry averages are benchmarked at a 1.00 EMR, with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization's ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols, resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk. In 2023, Fastenal had an EMR of 0.49, which is 51% better than the average performance rate for our industry.\n12 In 2023, we achieved third-party re-certification for the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This certification illustrates the strength of our health and safety programs, as well as our commitment to continual improvement to better support our growing workforce. As our business model continues to grow through our branch and Onsite network, our customer critical programs have evolved to mitigate risk and incidents, while meeting customer specific needs. This partnership with our customers allows us to collaborate and expand our health and safety programs to enhance our customers' workplace safety performance. Employment and Compensation Philosophy Fastenal's success is defined by our people. Our cultural values – Ambition, Integrity, Innovation, and Teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols, and inform our employment and compensation philosophies. Several principles underpin our employment philosophy. One principle is decentralization: placing employees close to our customers' operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service. A second principle is that we are a passionately promote-from-within company, guided by a belief that if you work hard, make great decisions, learn from mistakes, and exemplify our cultural values, you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility. We believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment. As it relates to our compensation philosophy, we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success, as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort. We are guided by simple principles. First, compensation programs should be easy to understand, with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided. They should be calculable by the employee and numbers-driven (e.g., not subjective). Second, total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers. Third, employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal.\nApproximately 71% of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis, with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customer-facing employees. Typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month, along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts, paid monthly, based on growth in sales, gross or pre-tax profit achieved, and prudent management of working capital. In certain roles, there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals, most of which are focused on either customer service or better execution of company-wide activities.\nBecause we believe the growth in the company's stock value should be the reward for achieving long-term success consistent with being an owner, we have a stock option plan. In the case of certain foreign employees, we have a stock appreciation rights plan. All of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights. We believe our combination of short- and long-term rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and levels of employee retention and turnover.\nOur employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.\nTalent Acquisition and Development Fastenal's values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons to stay include training, opportunity, and a welcoming environment. From a practical standpoint, this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities. In accordance with our decentralized leadership structure, we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening. In light of our promote-from-within philosophy, we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire.\nOur Human Resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage. We have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions, supplemented with training through the Fastenal School of Business (FSB). We have a Diversity and Compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework, which ensures its integrity. Not only is this process followed for all new hires, we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions.\n13 The FSB (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company-specific training and development programs that are offered to our employees. The programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructor-led training, virtual instructor-led training, and online learning. FSB provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees' performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning, as well as training plans based on roles within the company. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business, such as leadership, effective best practices, sales and marketing, products, supply chain, and distribution.\nProduct Sourcing Endeavors Sourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with all relevant regulations and applicable standards. Our teams conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us and require them to provide additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics, quality, and reliability. This ensures they meet our standards in these areas and are complying with Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing third-party tools and global databases, Fastenal actively monitors government sanctions, denied party listings, withhold release orders, export restriction updates, financial status, adverse media, and multiple other official exclusion lists that provide information on any known risk of any entities and locations with which Fastenal engages, and screens all business partners against those lists. Additionally, we monitor key areas of trade-related risk, including dual-use goods, trade cases, anti-dumping and counter-vailing cases, and other protectionist trade measures for all countries that products are traded in. As part of our comprehensive Supply Chain Security program, we also evaluate our suppliers' approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate, and appropriately compensated, employees and ensure upstream supply chain visibility on globally sourced products. With a local and global supplier base, continuous monitoring and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are triggered when risk may be evident, ensuring a safeguard against poor and/or impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation or ability to effectively operate in the marketplace. This is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding, but for the life of the relationship with the supplier. This process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of non-compliance or potential risk, we work with the supplier to correct the situation. If remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with Fastenal's standards and code of conduct, alternative sources of supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance, ensuring that no matter where a customers' operations may take them, Fastenal has the infrastructure, resources, and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations.\nIn 2023, approximately 29% of our total company-wide inventory spend was with small and/or diverse businesses.

The information contained on our website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on or through our website at www.fastenal.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n14 ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows: Company-Specific Risks Operational Risks Products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, or death linked to the use of those products by our customers. Some of our customers operate in challenging industries in which there is a material risk of catastrophic events. We are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers, some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk. If any of these events are linked to the use of any of our products by our customers, claims could be brought against us by those customers, by governmental authorities, and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them, we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place, the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available, or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us. Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems, or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner, could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues, and result in less efficient operations. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner. Our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities. Still, information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, cybersecurity incidents, telecommunication failures, and other problems. In addition, certain software used by us is licensed from, and certain services related to our information systems are provided by, third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us. It is also possible that we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our information systems. Our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of company and customer data, as well as the success of our growth drivers, is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems. If critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable, if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations, or if certain insurance coverages are limited in their capabilities or affordability, it could adversely affect our profitability and/or ability to grow.\nThe ability to adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. Additionally, our business relies on the use, validity, and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which include current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements, as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect our rights. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to liability, require us to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost, or otherwise cause us to modify our operations.\nCyber security incidents, or violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace. The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain, and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent such unauthorized access, and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event, including any cyber security event. The development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Consequently, despite our efforts, the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. There 15 can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security were to occur, it could interrupt our operations, subject us to additional legal, regulatory, and operating costs, and damage our reputation in the marketplace. In addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data. New privacy security laws and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016, the California Consumer Protection Act, and other similar privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. Our ability to successfully attract, develop, and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs, sales at existing selling locations, and the successful execution of our growth drivers. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including inside and outside branch associates, Onsite managers, national account sales representatives, and logistical and administrative support personnel, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high, particularly for less tenured employees. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels.\nChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could continue to cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. Changes in our customer and product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline. For example, we have experienced a sustained increase in the proportion of our sales attributable to both non-fastener products and national accounts and Onsite customers. Non-fastener products typically have a lower gross profit percentage than fasteners because in many cases non-fastener products are less technical, have shorter supply chains, and are easier to transport. Similarly, national accounts and Onsite customers typically have a lower gross profit percentage than smaller customers by virtue of their scale, available business, and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross profit percentages. Whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are offset by positive impacts to gross profit percentage during such year. Setting aside the circumstances of any given year or period, however, customer and product mix have contributed to the decline of our gross profit percentage over time and, based on the anticipated sources of our future growth, will likely continue to reduce our gross profit percentage into the foreseeable future. There are other variables that could cause our gross profit percentage to decline, including downward pressure on sales prices due to deflation, increases in overseas freight charges, the inability of freight revenue to leverage the expenses associated with our captive trucking fleet, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition. We could experience reductions in the volume of purchases we make from our suppliers, which could reduce supplier volume allowances. We may not be able to pass higher product costs along to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. We experienced a number of these variables in 2023. A softer manufacturing economy caused relative weakness in our more cyclical and higher gross margin fastener product line versus our non-fastener product lines. Similarly, we continued to execute initiatives aimed at accelerating key account penetration, which resulted in relative growth in our lower gross margin national account and Onsite customers. The combination of these two events produced pressure on our product gross profit percentage in 2023 from product and customer mix.\nOur operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings. Over time, we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses, including costs related to payroll, occupancy, freight, and information technology, among others, as our net sales have grown. However, historically, a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales, allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins. There are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past. For instance, it is typical that when demand declines, most commonly from cyclical or general market factors (though it could be due to customer losses or some other company-specific event), our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales. It is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales. In addition, market variables, which include but are not exclusive of labor rates, energy costs, legal costs, and health care costs, could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses so as to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings. Should any of these scenarios, or a combination of them, occur in the future, it is possible that our operating and pre-tax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue.\n16 Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and/or financial reporting could materially impact our business and results. Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. Any system of internal controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all systems of internal controls, internal controls over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation, economic loss, or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur competitive advantage in FMI solutions, which includes industrial vending (FASTVend) and bin stock (FASTStock and FASTBin) tools could be eliminated and, in the case of FASTVend and FASTBin, the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices. Certain circumstances could lead to a short-term inability to promote and/or install our FMI solutions. We believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software, our local presence (allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly and with less burden on our customers), our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks, and, particularly in North America, our distribution strength. These advantages have developed over time; however, other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own. Such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business. In addition, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for our vending devices, RFID technology, and IR technology used in our FASTVend and FASTBin platforms. While devices, software, and services can be obtained from other sources, loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in our failure to meet short- or long-term goals related to the numbers of FASTVend and FASTBin devices we are able to deploy. Certain circumstances may reduce short-term customer receptivity to adopting our FMI services. For instance, during periods of dramatic change in economic activity, some customers may prioritize managing existing operations over adopting new technologies until business circumstances change.\nOur inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations. Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership. In the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future, the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight and/or leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal, talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles. In addition, difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team, or recruiting suitable replacements, could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations.\nFailure to implement an effective Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy could result in financial losses or impair our corporate reputation. Customers, suppliers, employees, community partners, shareholders, and regulatory agencies are increasingly scrutinizing our ESG disclosures and practices and factoring the social impact of our policies and practices into whether and how they engage with us. Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: • the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; • the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; • increases in reporting and operating regulations around ESG may result in higher operating expenses and/or capital expenditures that could reduce our profitability and/or cash flow; • the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability, diversity, and other ESG standards that we may set; • the availability of effective and acceptable emission offset technologies or strategies in the event such tools will be necessary to achieve overall emission reduction and mitigation goals; and • our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets.\nAn actual or perceived inability to satisfactorily address the concerns and disclosure expectations of our stakeholders could adversely affect our corporate reputation, image, identity, brand equity, and status, which could hurt our ability to retain and acquire customers and employees, lead to penalties for non-compliance, and/or negatively impact the price performance of our common stock.\n17 We may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business. Our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within North America and abroad. In recent years, we have increased the resources devoted to developing a multi-dimensional, differentiated service offering, including our Digital Footprint (which incorporates our FMI and e-procurement capabilities), Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, and process and consumption analytics. While we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business, we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth. Failure to achieve any of our goals regarding our Digital Footprint, Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, analytics, or other growth drivers could negatively impact our long-term sales and profit growth. In addition, failure to identify appropriate targets for the growth drivers of our business or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our internally developed and/or externally communicated deployment objectives.\nThe ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our selling efforts and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete, our ability to generate additional sales, and our profit margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at our selling locations and through our specialist roles and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers' needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our selling locations and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins.\nThe ability to adequately protect our reputation may have an adverse impact on operations and profitability. The Fastenal name is valuable to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on our ability to provide high quality products, deliver consistent services, and improve our customer's business operations. Further, information on our company, including our products and services, can be more easily accessed and more quickly disseminated through traditional and social media and digital channels. Should we fail to deliver a positive customer experience or should our public image be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based in fact, it could jeopardize our reputation and discourage customers from purchasing our products and services, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to grow our revenues and profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or non-traditional competitors, which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although slowly consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented, and highly competitive industry. Our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, technological, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources, technological advancements, and services. Increased competition from brick-and-mortar retailers could cause us to lose market share, reduce our prices, or increase our spending. Similarly, the emergence of online retailers, whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major, non-traditional competitors, could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods. These pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage over time.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies. Historically, the vast majority of our growth has been organic. However, we have completed several acquisitions over the last decade and expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including, among others, a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business, inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition, diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues, and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business, our industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions. Equity Risks Our stock price will fluctuate, and at times these fluctuations may be volatile. The prices of markets and individual equities tend to fluctuate. These fluctuations commonly reflect events, many of which may be fully or partially outside of our control, that may change investor's perception of our future earnings growth prospects, including changes in economic conditions, ability to execute business strategy, the impacts of public policy, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, and many other factors. While the sources of stock price fluctuation can be common across companies, the magnitude of these fluctuations can vary for different companies. This is commonly measured by beta, which is an individual stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. Our stock price has traditionally had a high beta value, which means fluctuations in the price of our shares will often be sharper than what is experienced by broader market indices. We can provide no assurance that the above-average historical volatility of our stock versus the broader market will moderate. Volatility in our stock price could also result in the 18 filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management's time, attention, and resources. There can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time. Stock prices, including ours, are commonly thought to be a function of earnings compounded by a multiple. This is often referred to as a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, although other forms of multiples are often utilized by investors to value our company's shares. Historically, investors have given our earnings a higher multiple, or premium, than is typical of the broader industrial sector with which we are typically associated. We believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth, profitability, and returns. However, to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies and/or poorly navigate the risks that surround our business, including those described throughout this section, or to the extent our industry (industrial distribution, or industrial stocks in general) loses favor in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program. Although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates. In addition, although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2022, 2020, and prior years through these programs, we may discontinue doing so at any time. Any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, to increase those dividends, or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations, the price of our common stock, credit conditions, and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nGeneral Economic and Operating Risks Operational Risks A downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. In general, our sales are the result of planned and unplanned customer spending on products used in production of final goods, infrastructure construction, and/or the maintenance of facilities. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others: • general business conditions; • business conditions in our principal markets; • changes in the value of local currencies relative to our functional currency, the United States dollar, • interest rates; • increases (inflation) or decreases (deflation) in the cost of products from our vendors, transportation services, energy and fuel prices, and electrical power rates; • liquidity in credit markets; • taxation; • government regulations and actions; • the impact on customer demand or availability of goods and services based on labor shortages or work stoppages; • unemployment trends; • terrorist attacks and acts of war; • impact of higher sustained global temperatures (global warming); • acts of God, which may include, but are not limited to, weather events, earthquakes, pandemics, etc.; and • other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.\nA downturn in either the national or local economies where we operate, or in the principal markets served by us, or changes in any of the other factors described above, could negatively impact sales at our in-market locations, sales through our other selling channels, and the level of profitability of those in-market locations and other selling channels. The primary variable affecting our results in 2023 was a softening in manufacturing sector business conditions.\nProducts manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available, which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results. We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, and other foreign countries. Our suppliers could discontinue or experience disruption in selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers' control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations, disruption in trade relationships and agreements, political unrest, war, disease, labor availability, or changes in local economic conditions. Additionally, the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial, capacity, or other difficulties. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is 19 unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing products and services of comparable quality and utility. Trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult and/or more costly, and could adversely impact our gross and/or operating profit percentage. We source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of North America, primarily Asia. We have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from Asia through our wholly-owned, Asia-based subsidiary, FASTCO Trading Co., Ltd. and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources. This was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production, but over time we have expanded our non-fastener sourcing as well, and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term. In light of this, changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations, our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers and/or impact the cost or price of our products, with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results. China represents a significant source of product for North America. In addition, we move and source products within North America. Any trading disruption (tariffs, product restrictions, etc.) between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business. There can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future, with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business. The degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies, their timing and duration, and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues.\nChanges in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales, cost of sales, gross profit percentage, distribution expenses, and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating income. Our suppliers can experience significant fluctuation over time in the cost of raw materials (e.g., steel, plastic, etc.) used to produce their products. They can also experience significant fluctuation in the cost of energy consumed in their production processes and in the cost of fuel consumed to transport their products. These suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. We also consume energy and fuel in our own operations, and can experience direct and significant fluctuation in our own costs. Increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit to decline, or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries, which could cause our sales to those customers to decline. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales. Given that we were founded and remain based in the United States and that we are publicly traded in the United States, we report our results based on the United States dollar. Because the functional currency related to most of our non-United States operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar as our Mexican activities are primarily conducted in United States dollars and our non-North American operations are relatively small in scale. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure. If we decide to do so in the future, we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect. We believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that North American market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed $140 billion. This figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreed-upon demand and market share statistics. Instead, we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources. If we have overestimated the size of our market, and in doing so, underestimated our current share of it, the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe. Similarly, we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies, such as FMI solutions and Onsite locations. Within North America, we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 1.7 million devices and we have identified over 12,000 customer locations with the potential to implement our Onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base. We have identified additional markets, such as government, healthcare, and academia, and geographies into which we can sell our FMI solutions, which would increase the number of identified potential FMI solutions or Onsite locations. However, our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies, which could extend the sales cycle. As is the case for total market size, we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources. These estimates are based on our business model today, and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies could cause them to change. In 20 addition, the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace (such as changes in customer concentration or needs), a change in the nature of that business strategy, or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or Onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity.\nThe industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share, gross profit, and operating income. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating, reflecting two factors. First, our customer's needs are evolving to reflect a greater awareness of the total cost and risk of fulfillment and their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations, including outside of North America. Second, providing these capabilities to our customers requires increasing investment in hardware, software, and analytic capabilities that require a certain degree of scale to support. While we believe that in a fragmented market such as exists for industrial supplies these emerging trends favor large distributors such as Fastenal, as the industry consolidates into fewer and larger competitors it may become more difficult to differentiate our product and service offering from that of our competitors. We also continue to see consolidation among our suppliers. This trend could result in fewer and larger suppliers, with greater channel power and negotiating leverage. There can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation within our industry or among our suppliers. In either or both cases, the trend toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our growth and/ or gross and operating profit. Furthermore, as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors, or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share.\nThe occurrence of a widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A public health crisis, if sufficiently widespread as to affect economic activity, could negatively impact our business. Mitigation efforts and prescriptions may be facilitated by regulatory authorities, which could limit our flexibility to pursue alternative, potentially more favorable, means of limiting these negative impacts. The effects on our business efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis may include a reduction in demand, inefficiencies due to workplace accommodations, reduced availability of personnel, supply chain disruption, or constraints on product availability, among other difficulties. In any such event, the severity, duration, and extent of the crisis can be difficult to predict, which can make it difficult to anticipate the magnitude and length of the impact on our sales, profits, and/or cash flow. It can also be difficult to anticipate what the effect on business conditions will be as the impacts of any public health crisis fades and mitigating policies are reversed. Inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks Our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, damage to our reputation, or the termination of contracts. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption laws, product compliance laws, environmental laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, advertising regulations, data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016, with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country) and cyber security requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products, labor and employment laws, and anti-competition regulations. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation, administration, and performance of our governmental contracts. We are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business. Ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business, and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts. 21 Tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results. We are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, and/or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed which contained tax-related provisions. We did not experience, and do not anticipate experiencing in the near future, any meaningful impact to our tax rates from the legislation. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and legal matters, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal control, and other changes that could increase our operating costs. We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from business transactions or the operation of our business. Due to the nature of our business, these proceedings may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, suits arising from our trucking operations, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor, intellectual property matters, or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results. As of December 31, 2023, we had $260.0 of outstanding debt obligations, all in the form of senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement). The notes issued under our Master Note Agreement carry a fixed interest rate and consist of five series and are described in further detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We also have borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) of $835.0, but no loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the rate on which may vary daily, and mature on September 28, 2027. We currently have the capacity under our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement to increase borrowings in the future to finance stock purchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital additions, acquisitions, or other investments. Should we seek to increase our borrowings during periods of volatility and disruption in the United States credit markets, financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain. This was not a material consideration in 2023. The cost of servicing any existing balances on our Credit Facility could increase if interest rates increase due to the SOFR-based interest rate provided for under our Credit Facility.\nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.\n22 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have established processes and procedures for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. These processes are in place to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Annual risk assessments are performed and incorporated as part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) organizational process, which is overseen by our Board of Directors (the Board) and the Audit Committee, along with Executive Leadership. Our information security management system (ISMS) program is aligned to ISO 27001, which is an international standard to manage information security. ISO 27001 is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the world's largest developer of voluntary standards, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\nOur information technology (IT) security department, led by our Senior Vice President (SVP) IT Infrastructure & Security, is tasked with monitoring cybersecurity and operational risks related to information security and system disruption. The team employs measures designed to protect against, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats, and has implemented processes and procedures aligned with our information security management system to support and promote resilient programs. This includes: • Enterprise security framework and cyber security standards; • Cyber security awareness and training plans; • Security assessments and monitoring; • Restricted physical access to critical areas, servers, and network equipment; • Incident response, crisis management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans; and • Third-party IT vendor risk management process to identify, assess, and manage risks presented by our IT vendors and business partners.\nOur IT security department maintains a playbook to respond to potential cybersecurity threats. We conduct tabletop exercises for tactical response readiness, perform regular security scans of our environment both from an external and internal perspective, as well as work with a qualified third-party vendor to perform penetration tests of our environment. Any identified risks are included in our overall risk management program, and internal and external auditors validate our IT controls on a regular basis.\nWe conduct organization-wide cybersecurity training and compliance exercises in connection with our information security program. This training consists of educational material and compliance testing administered to all of our employees, which is tracked and recorded throughout the year. Results and progress are shared with Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board. Employee phishing tests are conducted on a regular basis. Employees who do not follow protocol are redirected for additional training. We have implemented an IT vendor risk management policy that provides guidance in managing risks associated with IT vendors and business partners. We have also established a third-party risk management program and conduct pre-onboarding security assessments and annual re-assessments of our service providers to collect, track, and manage third-party security controls based upon the risk presented to the business. Any issues identified during assessment are tracked through to remediation.\nGovernance Our Board of Directors and Audit Committee are actively engaged in the oversight of our risk management, including cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on information security from our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security. Additionally, Executive Leadership is briefed on information security at least quarterly by members of our IT security, compliance, governance, and audit teams. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing our risk exposure to information security, cybersecurity, and data protection, as well as the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our IT security department, which assesses and manages our risks from cybersecurity threats, is led by our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security, who reports to our Senior EVP IT. Additional oversight for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk include Executive sponsors, Information Technology, Human Resources, IT Governance Risk and Compliance, Internal Audit, and Legal, as well as members of our Information Security Risk Council, IT Risk Committee, and Enterprise Risk Management teams.\nWe have in place an incident response plan to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Information Security Risk Council, Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board are notified of any material cybersecurity incidents through an established escalation process. Additionally, we maintain a qualified third-party vendor relationship which is available to the team for on-demand incident response and investigation, as needed.\n23 The IT security department team members have degrees applicable to cybersecurity, including Bachelors in Information Systems, Computer Science, Management Information Systems and/or Masters in Cybersecurity, and hold professional certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Offensive Security Certified Professional, Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Defensible Security Architecture, GIAC Forensic Examiner, GIAC Incident Handling, and GIAC Open Source Intelligence. Our SVP IT Infrastructure & Security holds a Cybersecurity and Privacy Law Certificate from Mitchell Hamline School of Law, and has 28 years of experience in systems, network, and database administration. Additionally, our Senior IT security department manager is an Offensive Security Certified Professional, and holds GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC), with over 25 years of experience in network performance, availability, and protection.\nImpact of Cybersecurity Threats There have been no previous cybersecurity incidents which have materially affected us to date, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, any future potential risks from cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to exploitation of vulnerabilities, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain attacks, or other similar threats may materially affect us, including our execution of business strategy, reputation, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n24 ITEM 2.

This building is expected to be complete in June of 2025 and will be approximately 290,000 square feet.\n(6) In December 2018, we purchased an additional distribution center in High Point, North Carolina with approximately 750,000 total square feet. Approximately 395,000 square feet will be leased by the building's previous owner until December 2024. We currently utilize approximately 355,000 square feet for distribution activities.\n25 We also own, and in some cases, lease, the following support facilities, excluding selling locations: Location Purpose Leased Approximate Square Feet Winona, Minnesota Manufacturing facility 121,000 Indianapolis, Indiana Manufacturing facility 198,000 Houston, Texas Manufacturing facility 122,000 Wallingford, Connecticut Manufacturing facility 177,000 Rockford, Illinois Manufacturing facility 101,000 Johor, Malaysia Manufacturing facility 30,000 Brno-Lisen, Czech Republic Manufacturing facility X 20,000 Leeds, United Kingdom Manufacturing facility X 28,000 Winona, Minnesota Multiple facilities for office space, storage, and packaging operations 421,000 Bangalore, India International information technology office X 45,000 In addition, we own 154 buildings that house our in-market locations in various cities throughout North America.\nAll other buildings we occupy are leased. Leased branches range from approximately 3,000 to 20,000 square feet, with lease terms of up to 120 months (most initial lease terms are for 36 to 60 months).\nWe currently own land for future distribution center expansion and development. If economic conditions are suitable in the future, we will consider purchasing branch locations to house our older branches. It is anticipated the majority of new branch locations will continue to be leased. It is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular branch operations, when desirable. Our experience has been that there is sufficient space suitable for our needs and available for leasing.\nITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings, if any, is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.\n26 PART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Common Stock Data Dollar amounts in this section are stated in whole numbers.\nOur shares are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol 'FAST'.

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons for the current year and the prior year. Discussions of 2021 items can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Business and Operational Overview Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of more than 3,400 in-market locations. Our largest end market is manufacturing. Sales to these customers includes products for both original equipment manufacturing (OEM), where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers, and manufacturing, repair and operations (MRO), where our products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers. We also service general and commercial contractors in non-residential end markets as well as farmers, truckers, railroads, oil exploration companies, oil production and refinement companies, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our branches, Onsite locations, and customers are primarily located in North America, though we continue to grow our non-North American presence as well.\nIt is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace: First, it is big. We estimate the North American marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of $140 billion per year (and we have expanded beyond North America) and no company has a significant portion of this market. Second, many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive, but the cost and time to manage, procure, and transport these products can be quite meaningful. Third, many customers prefer to reduce their number of MRO and OEM suppliers to simplify their business, while also utilizing various technologies and models (including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly) to improve availability and reduce waste. Lastly, we believe the markets are efficient. In our view, this means that companies who grow market share are those that develop differentiated capabilities that provide the greatest value to the customer.\nOur approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto Growth Through Customer Service® and our tagline Where Industry Meets Innovation™. The concept of growth is simple: find more customers every day that value the services we provide and increase our activity with them. However, execution is hard work. First, we recruit service-minded individuals to support customers and empower them to operate in a decentralized fashion to maximize their flexibility to solve customer problems. We support these customer-facing resources with a supply chain capability that is speedy, efficient, and cost-effective. This has formed the foundation of our high-touch model since inception. Second, we invest in, develop, and deploy capabilities that allow us to illuminate and provide greater control over a customer's supply chain. These capabilities range from service models that take advantage of our local presence and/or our ability to more efficiently manage complex procurement needs, to hardware and software technologies that promote actionable data capture, improve operating efficiencies, and reduce supply chain risk. Third, we strive to generate strong profits, which produce the cash flow necessary to support our growth, our product and technology development, and the needs of our customers.\nThe ultimate aim of this 'high-touch, high-tech' approach to gaining market share is to allow us to get closer to our customers, going so far as to be right to the point of consumption within customers' facilities. Marrying our presence, capabilities and technologies deepens our relationships and our understanding of our customers' day-to-day opportunities and obstacles. This, in turn, enhances our ability to provide innovative and comprehensive solutions to our customers' challenges. By doing these things every day, Fastenal remains a growth-centric organization.\n29 Executive Overview The following table presents a performance summary of our results of operations for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 YOY Change 2021 YOY Change Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 5.2% $ 6,010.9 16.1% Business days 253 254 253 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 5.7% $ 23.8 15.7% Gross profit $ 3,354.5 3,215.8 4.3% $ 2,777.2 15.8% % of net sales 45.7% 46.1% 46.2% Operating and administrative expenses $ 1,825.8 1,762.2 3.6% $ 1,559.8 13.0% % of net sales 24.9% 25.2% 26.0% Operating income $ 1,528.7 1,453.6 5.2% $ 1,217.4 19.4% % of net sales 20.8% 20.8% 20.3% Earnings before income taxes $ 1,522.0 1,440.0 5.7% $ 1,207.8 19.2% % of net sales 20.7% 20.6% 20.1% Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 6.3% $ 925.0 17.5% Diluted net earnings per share $ 2.02 1.89 6.7% $ 1.60 17.8% Note – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the United States) in the period.\n2023 was a year of modest economic contraction in our key markets. The Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for the United States averaged 47.1 for the full year and remained below 50, the threshold demarcating manufacturing growth or contraction, every month. Industrial Production for the United States reflected moderating business activity, with markets that are most relevant to us, such as Fabricated Metals and Machinery, declining at an accelerating rate through the year. In addition, inflation in product costing flattened out, with some deflation emerging in fastener products. The combined effect of these dynamics was to produce daily sales growth in 2023 that slowed appreciably from 2022. We continued to migrate to a key accounts-focused model, expand our Onsite footprint, grow our installed base of FMI hardware, and lift the proportion of sales that run through our Digital Footprint. The efficiencies these investments provide and good organizational control of discretionary expenses allowed us to achieve a stable operating profit margin despite the challenges stemming from this slower and less inflationary environment. We also produced record operating cash flow which, combined with our confidence in the future cash generation capability of our business model, allowed us to pay a supplemental fifth dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full-time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our investments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of active Onsite locations), and weighted FMI devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period.\nQ4 2023 Q4 2022 Twelve-month % Change Selling personnel - absolute employee headcount 16,512 15,898 3.9 % Selling personnel - FTE employee headcount 15,070 14,476 4.1 % Total personnel - absolute employee headcount 23,201 22,386 3.6 % Total personnel - FTE employee headcount 20,721 19,854 4.4 % Number of branch locations 1,597 1,683 -5.1 % Number of active Onsite locations 1,822 1,623 12.3 % Number of in-market locations 3,419 3,306 3.4 % Weighted FMI devices (MEU installed count) 113,138 102,151 10.8 % 30 During the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 867. This reflects an increase in our total FTE selling personnel of 594 to support growth in the marketplace and sales initiatives targeting customer acquisition. We had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 124 to support increased product throughput at our facilities and to expand our local inventory fulfillment terminals (LIFTs). We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 149 that relates primarily to personnel investments in information technology, manufacturing, and operational support, such as purchasing and product development.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites activated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nTwelve-month Period 2023 2022 Branch openings 10 12 Branch closures, net of conversions (96) (122) Onsite activations 329 306 Onsite closures, net of conversions (130) (99) Our in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our in-market locations because of significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree international branches, which has more than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network. In any period, the number of locations closed tends to reflect normal churn in our business, whether due to redefining or exiting customer relationships, the shutting or relocation of customer facilities that host our locations, or a customer decision, as well as our ongoing review of underperforming locations. We will continue to open or close locations to sustain and improve our network, support our growth drivers, and manage our operating expenses. However, we believe the strategic rationalization that has produced the meaningful decline in our traditional branch network in the United States and Canada since 2013 is largely completed, and we expect reduced closing activity beginning in 2024. CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2023 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 45.7 % 46.1 % Operating and administrative expenses 24.9 % 25.2 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.8 % Net interest expense -0.1 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.7 % 20.6 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2023 2022 Net sales $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 Percentage change 5.2% 16.1% Business days 253 254 Daily sales $ 29.0 27.5 Percentage change 5.7% 15.7% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.3% -0.5% The increase in net sales noted above for 2023 was due to higher unit sales of MRO, OEM, and construction supplies, as well as higher pricing as further set forth below.\n31 We believe higher unit sales in 2023 were primarily a result of our ability to gain market share, as most measures of industrial activity were flat to down throughout the period. Despite this challenging environment, in 2023 we produced net sales growth of 5.2% and, owing to one fewer selling day in the period, daily sales growth of 5.7%. Growth was led by our transportation customers, which includes sales to transportation services customers as the warehousing operations of retailer-oriented customers, and manufacturing end markets, which benefit disproportionately from our shift to a key account model. Our non-residential construction and reseller customers contracted during the period, which we believe is due to our shift to a key account model which tends to de-emphasize walk-in, over-the-counter, and infrequent transactions. Price contributed 160 to 190 basis points to our net sales growth in 2023. This contribution to growth from price was primarily due to easier comparisons in the first six months of 2023. For instance, in the first six months of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 240 to 270 basis points, while in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 110 to 140 basis points and 50 to 80 basis points, respectively. We increased total Onsite locations, the installed base of FMI devices, and our Digital Footprint in 2023, which enhanced the value we provide to our customers and supported our growth and efficiency. The rate of penetration we achieved with these growth drivers was uneven, however. We signed 326 Onsites in 2023, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 375 to 400 units and slightly below the prior year signings of 356 units. We signed 24,126 FMI MEUs, meeting our goal at the start of 2023 of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs and meaningfully above the prior year signings of 20,735 MEUs. We expanded the proportion of our sales running through our Digital Footprint to 56.1%, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 65.0% but above the prior year level of 49.3%. Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2023 2022 Fasteners 32.4% 34.0% Safety supplies 21.2% 20.8% Other product lines 46.4% 45.2% The shifts in product mix in 2023 compared to 2022 are largely attributable to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. Second, pricing for fasteners has decelerated at a faster pace than non-fastener products. These dynamics produced a meaningful divergence in the daily sales growth rates of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2023.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2023 11.2% 9.6% 6.8% 7.8% 5.2% 4.7% 3.7% 3.6% 5.0% 1.9% 3.8% 5.3% 2022 14.9% 21.3% 19.1% 20.3% 17.6% 16.0% 18.1% 16.1% 13.7% 13.6% 10.2% 8.0% 32 Sequential Trends We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.\nHistory has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days and/or seasons impact certain end markets, particularly non-residential construction. The first landing centers on Easter and the Good Friday holiday that precedes it, which in any given year can fall in March or April, the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our non-residential construction business and with the Christmas/New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.\nThe table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2023' and '2022' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '23Delta' and '22Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark. It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform.

As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\n33 A graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2023 2022 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 End Market Performance We estimate approximately 70% to 75% of our business is with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing, a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market. The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 14.4% 10.4% 6.2% 4.7% 8.9% 2022 23.9% 23.1% 22.6% 16.0% 21.3% We estimate approximately 25% to 30% of our business is with customers engaged in a wide range of activities, none of which individually constitute 10% of sales. This includes non-residential construction, reseller, transportation, and government customers. The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 -3.7% -5.3% -1.3% 0.9% -2.4% 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 34 Product Performance Our products fall into two functional subsets: (1) original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts, which become part of a customer's finished good and (2) maintenance, repair, and operation (MRO), which maintain the facilities and equipment used by our customers.\nWhile certain products in our other product categories have an OEM application, such as welding consumables or metal cutting carbides, the majority of our sales for OEM applications are of fasteners. As a result, the best way to understand the change in our production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line (which represents 30% to 35% of our business). From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 7.0% 0.0% -2.0% -2.3% 0.7% 2022 24.6% 21.2% 18.2% 9.1% 18.1% By contrast, while we do sell significant quantities of MRO fasteners, the best way to understand the change in our MRO business is to examine the results in our non-fastener product lines, which include safety, tools, janitorial, and other products. From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 10.3% 9.2% 7.5% 6.6% 8.4% 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% Our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles, but because it is more dependent on whether a facility is operating than how much product that facility is producing, it does tend to exhibit less volatility in its growth than our fastener business. We also expect growth of our non-fastener products to outperform growth of our fastener products over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2023 45.7% 45.5% 45.9% 45.5% 45.7% 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.7% in 2023 and 46.1% in 2022. This decrease was primarily related to two factors. First, in 2023 customer and product mix had a negative effect on our gross profit percentage. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from larger customers, including Onsites, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we had higher organizational/overhead costs, including from higher inbound freight costs and working capital needs being relieved from inventory and generating higher period costs. These negative effects were partly offset by favorable freight costs, which reflects elevated domestic freight revenue leveraging what are relatively stable costs to support our captive fleet, lower expenses related to external freight providers, and lower fuel costs. Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 24.9% in 2023 from 25.2% in 2022. This primarily reflected improvement, as a percentage of net sales, in employee-related expenses as bonuses and commissions were down as a result of slower sales and profit growth in 2023 versus the prior year.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 3.4 % 14.7 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 4.2 % 2.6 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 4.2 % 18.5 % 35 Employee-related expenses include: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes.\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation. This was partly offset by a decline in bonuses reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 Selling personnel (1) 4.1 % 7.9 % Distribution/Transportation personnel 4.2 % 8.4 % Manufacturing personnel 0.1 % 12.4 % Organizational support personnel (2) 8.6 % 9.5 % Total personnel 4.4 % 8.3 % (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOccupancy-related expenses include: (1) building rent and depreciation, (2) building utility costs, (3) equipment related to our branches and distribution locations, and (4) industrial vending equipment and bins utilized as part of FMI services (we consider this hardware to be a logical extension of our in-market operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses).\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: slightly higher depreciation and expenses related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents related to higher inflation and branch size.\nAll other operating and administrative expenses include: (1) selling-related transportation, (2) information technology (IT) expenses, (3) general corporate expenses, which consists of legal expenses, general insurance expenses, travel and marketing expenses, etc., and (4) sales of property and equipment.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: higher spending on information technology; higher general insurance costs; increased spending on travel and supplies; and higher bad debt expense. These elements were only partly offset by increased contributions from our supplier collaboration programs and increased income from asset sales related to our field truck fleet.\nNet Interest Our net interest expense was $6.7 in 2023 compared to $13.6 in 2022. We carried lower average debt balances in 2023 relative to the prior year, with cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. This was only partly offset by slightly higher average rates against borrowings under our Credit Facility due to changing interest rate levels in the marketplace. We also generated higher interest income in 2023 relative to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes. The decrease in our tax rate in 2023 is due primarily to an increase in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options.\n36 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 1,155.0 1,086.9 Basic EPS 2.02 1.89 Diluted EPS 2.02 1.89 Percentage Change 2023 2022 Net earnings 6.3 % 17.5 % Basic EPS 6.7 % 17.7 % Diluted EPS 6.7 % 17.8 % 2023 2022 Tax Rate 24.1 % 24.5 % During 2023, net earnings per share increased, primarily due to higher sales, lower net interest expense, a lower tax rate, and lower average fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of our buying back shares in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash provided $ 1,432.7 941.0 % of net earnings 124.0% 86.6% In 2023, we experienced an increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. The improvement in operating cash flow in 2023, as a percent of net earnings, reflects the reduced demand for working capital as a result of an improved supply chain and, to a lesser degree, slower business activity relative to the prior year.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2023 2023 2023 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,087.6 74.4 7.3% Inventories 1,522.7 (185.3) -10.8% Trade working capital $ 2,610.3 (110.9) -4.1% Accounts payable $ 264.1 9.2 3.6% Trade working capital, net $ 2,346.2 (120.1) -4.9% Net sales in last three months $ 1,758.6 63.0 3.7% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to three factors. First, our receivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due to relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. Third, and to a lesser degree, customers have historically delayed payments at the end of years that are economically challenged, and we saw that effect in 2023.\n37 Our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity, though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable. One reason for this is because it is cyclical. We source significant quantities of product from overseas, and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. As a result, trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions. A second reason relates to product cost and the length of our supply chain. A significant proportion of our products, particularly fasteners, are sourced from Asia and transported primarily by ship and rail to our North American network for sale. This requires us to purchase a meaningful quantity of our products months in advance of those products being available for sale in our North American facilities. Product that is in transit is in our inventory but is not available for sale, which can create a lag in our ability to adjust inventory levels or costs in response to rapid changes in economic or cost conditions. A third reason for increases in our inventory balances is our growth drivers, including our FMI offerings, Onsite channel, and international expansion, all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory.\nIn 2023, our inventories decreased, reflecting the absence of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. Our response at the time was to deepen our inventory as a means of maintaining high service to our customers, particularly for imported inventory. Dissipation of these disruptions has allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle. It is also likely that slower business activity reduced the level of inventory our customers required us to maintain to meet their production needs.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in accounts payable was primarily attributable to our product purchases increasing to support the growth in our business. The growth in our accounts payable balance is below the growth in our sales, which reflects the dissipation of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. This allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2023 2022 Selling locations 64% 58% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 36% 42% Total 100% 100% Lease Obligations We have facilities, equipment, and vehicles leased under operating leases. A discussion of our lease obligations is contained in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Net cash used $ 161.2 163.0 % of net earnings 14.0% 15.0% Our net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was comparable to 2022 and primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures. Property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of: (1) purchases related to industrial vending, (2) purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers, (3) spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems, (4) the addition of fleet vehicles, (5) expansion, improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties, and (6) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, typically for the planned disposition of pick-up trucks as well as distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business, are netted against these purchases and additions.\n38 Set forth below is a recap of our 2023 and 2022 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2023 2022 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 83.9 97.8 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 24.0 21.5 Data processing software and equipment 33.4 30.6 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 7.0 12.4 Vehicles 24.5 11.5 Purchases of property and equipment 172.8 173.8 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (12.2) (11.4) Net capital expenditures 160.6 162.4 % of net sales 2.2% 2.3% % of net earnings 13.9% 14.9% Our net capital expenditures in 2023 were comparable to 2022, though they were below our original expectations for net capital investment during the year. The slower business environment in 2023 reduced the need to purchase certain equipment at the pace originally anticipated. We also saw the timing of certain outlays pushed out and, to a lesser extent, longer lead times on certain materials. It does not reflect the cancellation of any significant initiatives, and much of the spending is expected to occur in 2024 when we see our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, being in a range of $225.0 to $245.0. This increase reflects spending to complete our Utah distribution center, investments in picking technology and equipment in our hubs and branches, higher outlays for FMI hardware reflecting our higher targeted signings and a slight build in device inventory, and an increase in spending on information technology.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities The increase in net cash used in financing activities reflects higher dividend payments, including a supplemental payment in December of 2023, and a reduction in our outstanding debt obligations. These uses of cash were only partly offset by the absence of common stock purchases that we made in the prior year and, to a lesser degree, the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2023 2022 Cash dividends paid $ 1,016.8 711.3 % of net earnings 88.0% 65.4% Purchases of common stock — 237.8 % of net earnings —% 21.9% Total returned to shareholders $ 1,016.8 949.1 % of net earnings 88.0% 87.3% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (30.1) (9.2) % of net earnings -2.6% -0.8% Debt obligations payments (proceeds), net $ 295.0 (165.0) % of net earnings 25.5% -15.2% Net cash used $ 1,281.7 774.9 % of net earnings 111.0% 71.3% Stock Purchases In 2023, we did not purchase any of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\n39 Dividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on January 17, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78. This included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023 reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24.\nDebt In order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business, expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers, pay dividends, we have borrowed under our Credit Facility and our Master Note Agreement in recent periods.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2023 as follows: Peak borrowings 2023 First quarter $ 565.0 Second quarter 470.0 Third quarter 350.0 Fourth quarter 330.0 As of December 31, 2023, we had $0.0 outstanding under the Credit Facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount of $32.7. As of December 31, 2023, we had loans outstanding under the Master Note Agreement of $260.0. Descriptions of our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, debt, and lease obligations, each of which are discussed in more detail earlier in this section. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions but we do not believe any of these liabilities will be material. A discussion of income taxes is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnremitted Foreign Earnings Approximately $213.2 of cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries on December 31, 2023. These funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash. We have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the U.S., even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Inflation In 2023, we observed easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping) resulting in stable costs for most of our product offering. As a result, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2023 and we saw our contribution to growth in daily sales due to price moderate throughout the year. The exception to this stability was cost deflation for imported goods, which resulted in modest price deflation specifically in our fastener product line over the course of the year. The net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2023.\n40 PRIOR YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2022 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31: 2022 2021 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 46.1 % 46.2 % Operating and administrative expenses 25.2 % 26.0 % Operating income 20.8 % 20.3 % Net interest expense -0.2 % -0.2 % Earnings before income taxes 20.6 % 20.1 % Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales The table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period: 2022 2021 Net sales $ 6,980.6 6,010.9 Percentage change 16.1% 6.4% Business days 254 253 Daily sales $ 27.5 23.8 Percentage change 15.7% 7.3% Daily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.5% 0.6% The increase in net sales noted above for 2022 was due to higher unit sales of MRO and OEM supplies to traditional manufacturing and construction customers and higher pricing as further set forth below.\nHigher unit sales in 2022 were a result of healthy economic activity throughout the period, though we did observe some moderation in demand as the year progressed. This moderation in demand, combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed, produced daily sales growth of 18.1% in the first half of 2022, daily sales growth of 13.3% in the second half of 2022, and daily sales growth of 8.0% in December 2022. Growth was led by our manufacturing customers, with particular strength in markets involved with commodity and capital goods production. Our non-residential construction customers grew on an annual basis, but turned slightly negative in the fourth quarter. We believe the relative underperformance of this customer category reflects deliberate shifts in our branch strategy that de-emphasized walk-in and over-the-counter transactions. We also experienced a normalization in other aspects of the operating environment in 2022, specifically the dissipation or moderation over the course of the year of product and transportation inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor market constraints. This affected two aspects of our growth during the period.\nFirst, price contributed 540 to 570 basis points to our net sales growth in 2022. However, as inflationary pressures eased and product availability improved, the need for aggressive pricing actions declined. The absence of such actions combined with more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progressed resulted in the contribution from price to net sales growth moderating, from averaging 620 to 650 basis points in the first half of 2022, to averaging 450 to 480 basis points in the second half of 2022 and to averaging 350 to 380 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nSecond, as inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints became more predictable and manageable and then largely dissipated, it allowed our customers to shift from short-term business management to long-term strategic planning. This, in turn, provided us more opportunities to engage with customers over our key growth drivers, including Onsite and FMI. As a result, while we did not reach the signings goals we had set out at the start of the year, we saw a meaningful increase in signings in 2022 over the prior year, and a return to near pre-pandemic levels. We signed 356 Onsites in 2022, below our goal of 375 to 400 units but above the prior year (274 signings). Similarly, we signed 20,735 FMI MEUs, below our goal of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs but above the prior year (19,311 MEUs).\n41 Sales by Product Line From a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows: 2022 2021 Fasteners 34.0% 33.3% Safety supplies 20.8% 21.2% Other product lines 45.2% 45.5% The shifts in product mix in 2022 compared to 2021 largely reflect the reversal of pandemic-related activity combined with the relative growth of our more cyclical fastener line as growth in manufacturing and construction end markets accelerated as the post-pandemic North American economy recovered.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month During the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year): Jan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2022 14.9 % 21.3 % 19.1 % 20.3 % 17.6 % 16.0 % 18.1 % 16.1 % 13.7 % 13.6 % 10.2 % 8.0 % 2021 6.5 % 1.5 % 7.5 % 1.2 % -3.2 % 1.7 % 9.7 % 9.0 % 11.1 % 14.1 % 13.2 % 16.5 % Sequential Trends The table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2022' and '2021' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '22Delta' and '21Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark.\n42 It is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform.\nJan.

As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that excludes 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nA graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows: Sequential Daily Sales Change Benchmark 2022 2021 Previous Oct.\nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay June July Aug.\nSept.\nOct.\n90 100 110 120 43 End Market Performance The DSR change to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 23.9 % 23.1 % 22.6 % 16.0 % 21.3 % 2021 5.6 % 24.5 % 20.8 % 23.8 % 18.4 % The DSR change to these remaining non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows: DSR change - non-manufacturing customers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 6.9% 6.9% 1.0% -0.8% 3.5% 2021 4.9% -30.7% -8.2% -2.3% -11.3% Product Performance From a company perspective, the DSR change of fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 24.6 % 21.2 % 18.2 % 9.1 % 18.1 % 2021 4.0 % 28.4 % 20.2 % 24.2 % 18.8 % From a company perspective, the DSR change of non-fasteners, when compared to the same period in the prior year, was as follows (note: this information includes all end markets): DSR change - non-fasteners Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 15.0% 16.0% 14.4% 11.6% 14.2% 2021 6.1% -10.8% 5.1% 9.6% 1.9% Two product lines, safety and janitorial, accounted for approximately 44% of total non-fastener sales in 2022. The pattern in 2021, and particularly the second quarter of 2021, was affected by difficult comparisons versus the prior year, when the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge of safety and janitorial supplies that was not repeated to the same degree in 2022. Setting aside the unique circumstances surrounding the pandemic, our non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles. However, we would typically expect it to outperform our fastener business over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. Gross Profit The gross profit percentage during each period was as follows: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Annual 2022 46.6% 46.5% 45.9% 45.3% 46.1% 2021 45.4% 46.5% 46.3% 46.5% 46.2% Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.1% in 2022 and 46.2% in 2021, a decrease of 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily related to three factors. First, in 2022 we experienced relatively higher growth from our large and Onsite customers, which tend to have a lower gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. This was only partly offset by favorable product mix resulting from relatively higher growth from our fasteners products during the year, which tend to have a higher gross margin percentage than the business as a whole. Second, in the second half of 2022, we did not pass through pricing sufficient to offset higher costs, which resulted in an adverse impact on our gross margin percentage. Third, in the second half of 2022, we experienced lower product margins for certain categories of our other products. We believe slower demand and greater product availability in the marketplace due to supply chain normalization has put some pressure on products that tend to be sold less frequently by our business units. These factors were mostly offset by a reduction in the amount of pandemic-related write-downs and narrower losses to operate our truck fleet related to our strong freight revenue growth leveraging relatively stable fleet costs.\n44 Operating and Administrative Expenses Our operating and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.2% in 2022 from 26.0% in 2021. This reflected a decline, as a percentage of net sales, in employee- and occupancy-related expenses.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage of Total Operating and Administrative Expenses Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Employee-related expenses 70% to 75% 14.7 % 11.6 % Occupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 2.6 % 3.9 % All other operating and administrative expenses 10% to 15% 18.5 % 4.9 % Our employee-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher base pay and employment taxes from higher FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation; an increase in bonuses and commissions resulting from improved sales and profitability; and an increase in our profit sharing contribution. This was partly offset by a decline in health insurance costs, as the use of medical services by employees normalized following the post-pandemic catch-up activity in 2021. The table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period: Twelve-month Period 2022 2021 Selling personnel (1) 7.9% 1.7% Distribution/Transportation personnel 8.4% 5.8% Manufacturing personnel 12.4% 2.0% Organizational support personnel (2) 9.5% 7.4% Total personnel 8.3% 2.8% (1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. (2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; slightly higher depreciation related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; and slightly higher facility costs, with higher utility costs being only partly offset by lower rents stemming from branch consolidations.\nCombined, all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2022 from 2021. This was related to: higher costs related to selling-related transportation, including higher fuel costs; higher spending on information technology; higher spending on travel, meals, and supplies; and higher general insurance expense. These elements were only partly offset by lower bad debt expense.\nNet Interest Expense Our net interest expense was $13.6 in 2022 compared to $9.6 in 2021. We carried higher average debt balances in 2022 relative to the prior year, and specifically higher balances of variable rate credit facility debt, as a result of high sustained working capital needs and an increase in share buybacks. We also incurred higher average interest rates during the year due to changes in interest levels in the marketplace.\nIncome Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of earnings before income taxes, compared to $282.8 in 2021, or 23.4% of earnings before income taxes. The increase in our tax rate in 2022 is due primarily to reduced benefits associated with the exercise of stock options, an increase in state income tax expense, and an absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited 2021.\n45 Net Earnings Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), the percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows: Dollar Amounts 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 1,086.9 925.0 Basic EPS 1.89 1.61 Diluted EPS 1.89 1.60 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Net earnings 17.5 % 7.7 % Basic EPS 17.7 % 7.5 % Diluted EPS 17.8 % 7.4 % 2022 2021 Tax Rate 24.5 % 23.4 % During 2022, net earnings increased, primarily due to higher sales and our ability in the period to grow costs more slowly than we grew sales. This was only slightly offset by a higher income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash provided $ 941.0 770.1 % of net earnings 86.6% 83.3% In 2022, we experienced a slight increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, though this reflects a significant increase in our conversion percentage in the second half of 2022 which more than offset a significant decline in our conversion percentage in the first half of 2022. Taken as a whole, while our working capital needs remained elevated through 2022, they declined slightly on a year-over-year basis whereas our earnings increased on a year-over-year basis.\nTrade Working Capital Assets The following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31: Twelve-month Dollar Change Twelve-month Percentage Change 2022 2022 2022 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,013.2 113.0 12.6% Inventories 1,708.0 184.4 12.1% Trade working capital $ 2,721.2 297.4 12.3% Accounts payable $ 255.0 21.9 9.4% Trade working capital, net $ 2,466.2 275.5 12.6% Net sales in last three months $ 1,695.6 969.8 16.1% Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2022, the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflected several factors. First, our receivables are expanding due to improved business activity and resulting growth in our customers' sales. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our customer mix due to relatively stronger sales growth from national account customers, which tend to be larger and carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. 46 In 2022, our inventories increased, reflecting significant inflation in the value of stocked parts, the addition of inventory to support the growth of our manufacturing and construction customers as they expand production to meet improved business activity, deeper inventory stocking due to disruption in supply chains, and our efforts to sustain higher internal fulfillment rates. In 2022, the annual growth in accounts payable reflected product purchases increasing to support the improvement in business activity at our manufacturing and construction customers.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end: 2022 2021 Selling locations 58% 57% Distribution center and manufacturing locations 42% 43% Total 100% 100% Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Net cash used $ 163.0 148.5 % of net earnings 15.0% 16.1% The changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was primarily related to higher net capital expenditures. Set forth below is a recap of our 2022 and 2021 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings: 2022 2021 Manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities $ 97.8 70.3 Shelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations 21.5 11.0 Data processing software and equipment 30.6 28.0 Real estate and improvements to branch locations 12.4 37.9 Vehicles 11.5 9.4 Purchases of property and equipment 173.8 156.6 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (11.4) (8.4) Net capital expenditures 162.4 148.2 % of net sales 2.3% 2.5% % of net earnings 14.9% 16.0% Our net capital expenditures increased in 2022, when compared to 2021. The most significant area driving this increase was higher spending on FMI equipment. We had slightly higher property spending, which reflected significant investments in automation and upgrades at our hubs mostly offset by lower spending on a new building in downtown Winona, which was completed in 2021. We had only modest increases related to our vehicle fleet, manufacturing operations, and information technology. Net capital expenditures in 2022 were below our anticipated range of $170.0 to $190.0 due to certain equipment and project delays related to hub projects.\n47 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities were due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases. These amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments (proceeds) from debt obligations. Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows: 2022 2021 Cash dividends paid $ 711.3 643.7 % of net earnings 65.4% 69.6% Purchases of common stock 237.8 — % of net earnings 21.9% —% Total returned to shareholders $ 949.1 643.7 % of net earnings 87.3% 69.6% Proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ (9.2) (31.6) % of net earnings -0.8% -3.4% Debt obligations (proceeds) payments, net $ (165.0) 15.0 % of net earnings -15.2% 1.6% Net cash used $ 774.9 627.1 % of net earnings 71.3% 67.8% Stock Purchases In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share. In 2021, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe had authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization did not have an expiration date.\nDividends We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on January 18, 2023. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24. In 2021, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.12.\nDebt Our borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2022 as follows: Peak borrowings 2022 First quarter $ 525.0 Second quarter 595.0 Third quarter 650.0 Fourth quarter 710.0 Effects of Inflation In 2022, we began to observe easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping). However, this did not translate into a reduction in inflationary pressures on our financial results for two reasons. First, inflationary pressures accelerated through 2021, and many periods in 2022 were comparing to lower cost levels in the preceding year. Second, we have a long supply chain for many products, and it can take several quarters from when inflationary pressures begin to recede for the effect to impact our earnings results. In 2022, we increased prices, sought alternative sources for products and services, and consolidated spend for products and services as a means of mitigating inflation. However, higher product and transportation costs did have a slightly negative effect on our gross margin percentage for the full year. 48 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Inventories, are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following: Allowance for Credit Losses – This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nInventory valuation – Adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels, sales information, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory, or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nGeneral insurance reserves – These reserves are for general claims related to workers' compensation, property and casualty losses, and other general liability self-insured losses. The reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends. We perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels. We analyze historical trends, claims experience, and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, if any, is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity steel pricing, commodity energy prices, and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows: Import shipping costs – We import a significant quantity of our products, particularly fasteners and private label products, from foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. As a result, we incur costs related to shipping charges, duties, harbor fees, and sundry other expenses involved in the movement of product for sale in North America and our other global locations. These costs are embedded in our product values, and significant fluctuations can affect our product gross profit depending on what mitigating actions might be taken. The most significant contributor to these fluctuations is the cost of overseas shipping containers. During 2023, the cost of overseas shipping containers was below the prior year. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to import shipping costs was $23.0 to $28.0 in 2023. Commodity steel prices – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. During 2023, the price of steel as reflected in many market indexes has been below prior year levels, though in most cases price levels have stabilized in recent periods and the rate of decline is moderating. Due to our long supply chain, changes in the cost of steel can take a number of quarters to be reflected in our financial results. Further, the cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the steel products that we sell, which can also diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. We estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity steel prices was immaterial in 2023.\nCommodity energy prices – We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity. As reflected in many market indexes, energy prices during 2023 were generally below prior year levels, which contributed to lower costs for fuel consumed in our vehicles and lower utility costs at our facilities. Total direct fuel consumption is a relatively minor cost to the company and, as a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to commodity energy prices was immaterial in 2023. Fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell. During 2023, prices for fossil fuels were generally below prior year levels. The cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the products that we sell, which can diminish the impact of cost changes for the raw material. As a result, we estimate the effect on our net earnings related to materials for which fossil fuels are a feedstock was immaterial in 2023.\nForeign currency exchange rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments, our operations in countries other than the U.S., and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material. We estimate the effect on our sales and net earnings related to changes in foreign exchange rates was $18.7 and immaterial, respectively, in 2023.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates. As a result, changes in such rates can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage point increase to our floating rate debt in 2023 would have resulted in approximately $0.6 of additional interest expense. A description of our Credit Facility is contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 ITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Fastenal Company: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fastenal Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II — valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n51 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of audit evidence over inventory quantities at in-market locations As disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet, the Company held $1,522.7 million of inventory, the majority of which was held at 3,419 in-market locations, as of December 31, 2023. The Company's processes to track and determine consolidated inventory relies on a perpetual inventory system which involves the interaction of information technology (IT) systems.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the quantities of inventory at in-market locations as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over quantities of inventory at in-market locations required challenging auditor judgment to assess the number of in-market locations visited and included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge due to the interaction of IT systems that track physical inventory quantities by location.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included IT application controls, as well as certain controls related to access to programs and data, program changes, and computer operations. It also included certain controls related to the Company's physical inventory cycle counts. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing certain IT controls, inclusive of the interface of IT systems, which support the Company's perpetual inventory system. We applied auditor judgment in the determination of the locations to test the Company's inventory quantities by evaluating: • Homogeneity of the locations; • Historical inventory locations we have visited and results of prior physical counts; • Inventory dollars by location; and • The Company's inventory cycle count results, including the results of monitoring and compliance with cycle count program by in-market location.\nWe tested the existence and completeness of inventory by counting inventory quantities on a sample basis through in-market location visits during the year to evaluate the Company's perpetual inventory records. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over the quantities of inventory at in-market locations.\n/s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.

Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Overview Fastenal is a leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of branches and Onsite locations. Collectively, we refer to our branches and Onsite locations as in-market locations. We have more than 3,400 in-market locations located primarily in North America.\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fastenal Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, referred to as Fastenal or by terms such as we, our, or us). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns and any related sales incentives. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when or as we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by transferring control of the promised products to the customer, with the majority of revenue recognized at the point in time the customer obtains control of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Using probability assessments, which are based on known inputs at year-end, we estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the contract. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation and are short term in nature. Sales taxes and value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.\nAccounts Receivable Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions The functional currency of our foreign operations is typically the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into United States dollars for balance sheet accounts, except retained earnings, using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, for retained earnings at historical exchange rates, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the applicable period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders' equity captioned accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in cost of sales or operating and administrative expenses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories Inventories, consisting of finished goods merchandise held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value. We record valuation adjustments for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory that are equal to the difference between the cost and estimated net realizable value for that inventory. These estimates are based on a review and comparison of the current inventory levels to projected and historical sales of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided for using the straight-line method over the anticipated economic useful lives of the related property.\nLeases We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, the current portion of operating lease liabilities, and the operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 The ROU assets represent our right to control the use of an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent, taxes, and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area or other maintenance costs) which are accounted for as a single lease component as we have elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components for all leases. Our pick-up truck leases typically have a non-cancelable lease term of less than one year and therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to exclude these short-term leases from our ROU assets and lease liabilities. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at our sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. We regularly evaluate the renewal options and when they are reasonably certain of exercise, we include the renewal period in our lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. We have a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment, we apply a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid deposits, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets, and are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as necessary. There were no impairments recorded during any of the three years reported in these consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nInsurance Reserves We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, health, and general liability costs. Specific stop-loss coverage is provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Self-insurance liabilities are based on our estimate of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nProduct Warranties We offer a basic limited warranty for certain of our products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. We typically recoup these costs through product warranties we hold with the original equipment manufacturers. Our warranty expense has historically been minimal.\nStock-Based Compensation We estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in operating and administrative expenses. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 59 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options considered to be 'in-the-money' (i.e., when the market price of our stock is greater than the exercise price of our outstanding stock options).\nSegment Reporting We have determined that for our North American regions we meet the aggregation criteria outlined in the accounting standards as these regions have similar: (1) economic characteristics, (2) products and services, (3) customers, (4) distribution channels, and (5) regulatory environments. Considering our operations outside of North America represent less than 10% of our net sales, net earnings, or assets, we report as a single business segment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reporting requirements under Topic 280. The enhanced disclosure requirements include: title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), significant segment expenses provided to the CODM, extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarifying single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, and permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain circumstances. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply retrospectively to all periods presented.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. The new guidance requires consistent categorization and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as further disaggregation of income taxes paid. This change is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply on a prospective basis to annual financial statements for periods beginning after the effective date. However, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 60 Note 2. Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue The accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the selling location from which the sale occurred. During 2023, 2022, and 2021, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nOur revenues related to the following geographic areas were as follows for the periods ended December 31: Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 2021 United States $ 6,139.8 5,867.1 5,033.3 % of revenues 83.6% 84.0% 83.7% Canada and Mexico 981.9 884.4 749.0 % of revenues 13.4% 12.7% 12.5% North America 7,121.7 6,751.5 5,782.3 % of revenues 97.0% 96.7% 96.2% All other foreign countries 225.0 229.1 228.6 % of revenues 3.0% 3.3% 3.8% Total revenues $ 7,346.7 6,980.6 6,010.9 The percentages of our sales by end market were as follows for the periods ended December 31: Twelve-month Period 2023 2022 2021 Manufacturing 74.3% 72.2% 68.9% Non-residential construction 9.1% 10.3% 11.1% Other 16.6% 17.5% 20.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% The percentages of our sales by product line were as follows for the periods ended December 31: Twelve-month Period Type Introduced 2023 2022 2021 Fasteners (1) 1967 32.4% 34.0% 33.3% Tools 1993 8.5% 8.4% 8.5% Cutting tools 1996 5.3% 5.0% 5.0% Hydraulics & pneumatics 1996 6.7% 6.5% 6.4% Material handling 1996 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Janitorial supplies 1996 8.4% 8.0% 8.2% Electrical supplies 1997 4.6% 4.4% 4.3% Welding supplies 1997 4.1% 3.9% 3.8% Safety supplies 1999 21.2% 20.8% 21.2% Other 3.2% 3.3% 3.7% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% (1) The fastener product line represents fasteners and miscellaneous supplies.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 61 Note 3. Long-Lived Assets The accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid deposits, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets.\nProperty and equipment at year end consisted of the following: Depreciable Life in Years 2023 2022 Land — $ 67.2 67.5 Buildings and improvements 15 to 40 525.1 509.2 Automated distribution and warehouse equipment 5 to 30 271.7 269.2 Shelving, industrial vending, and equipment 3 to 10 1,366.5 1,283.8 Transportation equipment 3 to 5 98.3 85.7 Construction in progress — 107.8 96.0 2,436.6 2,311.4 Less accumulated depreciation (1,425.5) (1,301.4) Property and equipment, net $ 1,011.1 1,010.0 Our long-lived assets related to the following geographic areas at year end: 2023 2022 United States $ 1,314.2 1,303.4 Canada and Mexico 87.2 80.4 North America 1,401.4 1,383.8 All other foreign countries 40.6 40.0 Total long-lived assets $ 1,442.0 1,423.8 Note 4.

Stockholders' Equity Dividends On January 17, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share of common stock to be paid in cash on February 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.78, which included a special, one-time dividend of $0.38 per share. We paid aggregate annual cash dividends per share of $1.24 and $1.12 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Options Effective January 2, 2024, the compensation committee of our board of directors granted to our employees options to purchase a total of 764,195 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. On the same date, certain of our non-employee directors received options to acquire a total of 50,717 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $64.00 per share. The closing stock price on the effective date of the grants was $63.55 per share.\nThe following tables summarize the details of options granted under our stock option plans that were still outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and the assumptions used to value those grants. All such grants were effective at the close of business on the date of grant.\nOptions Granted Option Exercise Price Closing Stock Price on Date of Grant December 31, 2023 Date of Grant Options Outstanding Options Exercisable January 3, 2023 1,071,943 $ 48.00 $ 47.400 989,048 70,562 January 3, 2022 713,438 $ 62.00 $ 61.980 611,848 53,355 January 4, 2021 741,510 $ 48.00 $ 47.650 591,206 211,323 January 2, 2020 902,263 $ 38.00 $ 37.230 658,884 322,242 January 2, 2019 1,316,924 $ 26.00 $ 25.705 758,611 451,061 January 2, 2018 1,087,936 $ 27.50 $ 27.270 541,026 419,460 January 3, 2017 1,529,578 $ 23.50 $ 23.475 523,828 426,290 April 19, 2016 1,690,880 $ 23.00 $ 22.870 245,075 188,177 April 21, 2015 1,786,440 $ 21.00 $ 20.630 54,552 54,552 Total 10,840,912 4,974,078 2,197,022 Date of Grant Risk-free Interest Rate Expected Life of Option in Years Expected Dividend Yield Expected Stock Volatility Estimated Fair Value of Stock Option January 3, 2023 4.0% 5.00 2.6% 29.58% $ 11.62 January 3, 2022 1.3% 5.00 1.7% 28.52% $ 13.68 January 4, 2021 0.4% 5.00 2.0% 29.17% $ 9.57 January 2, 2020 1.7% 5.00 2.4% 25.70% $ 6.81 January 2, 2019 2.5% 5.00 2.9% 23.96% $ 4.40 January 2, 2018 2.2% 5.00 2.3% 23.45% $ 5.02 January 3, 2017 1.9% 5.00 2.6% 24.49% $ 4.20 April 19, 2016 1.3% 5.00 2.6% 26.34% $ 4.09 April 21, 2015 1.3% 5.00 2.7% 26.84% $ 3.68 All of the options in the tables above vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years. Generally, each option will terminate approximately 10 years after the grant date.\nThe fair value of each share-based option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the assumptions listed above. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the time of grant. The expected life is the average length of time over which we expect the employee groups will exercise their options, net of forfeitures, which is based on historical experience with similar grants. The dividend yield is estimated over the expected life of the option based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends. Expected stock volatilities are based on the movement of our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 63 A summary of activities under our stock option plans consisted of the following: Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2023 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Granted 1,071,943 $ 48.00 9.00 Exercised (1,170,693) $ 25.69 Cancelled/forfeited (301,908) $ 45.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 4,974,078 $ 38.70 5.99 Exercisable as of December 31, 2023 2,197,022 $ 30.88 4.54 Options Outstanding Exercise Price (1) Remaining Life (2) Outstanding as of January 1, 2022 5,173,270 $ 30.23 6.08 Granted 713,438 $ 62.00 9.00 Exercised (346,992) $ 26.78 Cancelled/forfeited (164,980) $ 40.00 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 5,374,736 $ 34.37 5.66 Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 2,437,636 $ 27.14 4.30 (1) Weighted average exercise price.\n(2) Weighted average remaining contractual life in years.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $38.1, $10.2, and $38.8, respectively. The intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the underlying shares at the date of exercise. At December 31, 2023, there was $16.6 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options granted under the employee stock option plan. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.18 years. Any future change in estimated forfeitures will impact this amount. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested under our employee stock option plan during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $5.3, $5.2, and $4.8, respectively.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option plan was $7.3, $7.2, and $5.6 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nShares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year 570,811,674 575,464,682 574,159,575 Stock options exercised 1,170,693 346,992 1,305,107 Purchases of common stock — (5,000,000) — Balance at end of year 571,982,367 570,811,674 575,464,682 Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 64 Earnings Per Share The following tables present a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share and a summary of the options to purchase shares of common stock which were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive: Reconciliation 2023 2022 2021 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 571,271,846 573,777,790 574,808,030 Weighted shares assumed upon exercise of stock options 1,736,762 1,845,324 2,309,026 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 573,008,608 575,623,114 577,117,056 Summary of Anti-dilutive Options Excluded 2023 2022 2021 Options to purchase shares of common stock 1,568,460 1,335,898 678,310 Weighted average exercise prices of options $ 53.80 55.25 48.00 Any dilutive impact summarized above related to periods when the average market price of our stock exceeded the exercise price of the potentially dilutive stock options then outstanding.\nNote 6. Retirement Savings Plan The Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan covers all of our employees in the United States. Our employees in Canada may participate in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The general purpose of both of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings contributions. In addition to the participation of our employees, we make annual profit sharing contributions based on an established formula. The expense recorded under this profit sharing formula was approximately $23.1, $22.1, and $17.4 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Note 7.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $9.2 as of December 31, 2023 and $8.6 as of December 31, 2022. We believe it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $1.4 in unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2024 as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations. The 2023 and 2022 liability is included in deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, all states, and various local and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before 2020 in the case of United States federal examinations, and with limited exception, before 2018 in the case of foreign, state, and local examinations.\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of our approximately $514.7 of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 66 Note 8. Operating Leases We lease space under non-cancelable operating leases for several distribution centers, several manufacturing locations, and certain branch locations. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. We also lease certain semi-tractors, pick-up trucks, and computer equipment under operating leases. Certain operating leases for pick-up trucks contain residual value guarantee provisions which would generally become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. The aggregate residual value guarantee related to these leases was approximately $118.4. We believe the likelihood of funding the guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease agreements is remote. The cost components of our operating leases were as follows for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total Operating lease cost $ 99.4 18.2 117.6 96.8 14.7 111.5 99.7 13.7 113.4 Variable lease cost 10.5 1.6 12.1 9.7 1.5 11.2 10.4 1.3 11.7 Short-term lease cost — 23.7 23.7 — 26.6 26.6 — 19.2 19.2 Total $ 109.9 43.5 153.4 106.5 42.8 149.3 110.1 34.2 144.3 Variable lease costs are excluded from ROU assets and lease liabilities and consist primarily of taxes, insurance, and common area or other maintenance costs for our leased facilities and equipment which are paid based on actual costs incurred by the lessor as well as variable mileage costs related to our leased vehicles.\nMaturities of our lease liabilities for all operating leases were as follows as of December 31, 2023: Leased Facilities and Equipment Leased Vehicles Total 2024 $ 86.1 14.2 100.3 2025 65.1 12.1 77.2 2026 43.3 8.9 52.2 2027 26.5 5.1 31.6 2028 14.7 3.1 17.8 2029 and thereafter 13.0 1.5 14.5 Total lease payments $ 248.7 44.9 293.6 Less: Imputed interest (15.2) (3.4) (18.6) Present value of lease liabilities $ 233.5 41.5 275.0 The weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for all of our operating leases were as follows for the periods ended December 31: Remaining lease term and discount rate: 2023 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) Leased facilities and equipment 3.76 3.57 Leased vehicles 3.77 2.66 Weighted average discount rate Lease facilities and equipment 3.07% 2.07% Leased vehicles 4.03% 2.47% Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 67 Supplemental cash flow information related to our operating leases was as follows for the periods ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash outflow from operating leases $ 115.7 110.9 112.4 Leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 116.2 89.4 103.6 Note 9.

The Credit Facility includes a committed letter of credit subfacility of $55.0. Any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility for which we have the ability and intent to pay using cash within the next 12 months will be classified as a current liability. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants, and our right to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our compliance with these covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus a 0.10% spread adjustment plus 0.95%. We pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Credit Facility. This fee is either 0.10% or 0.125% per annum based on our usage of the Credit Facility.\nSenior Unsecured Promissory Notes Payable We have issued senior unsecured promissory notes under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement) in the aggregate principal amount of $260.0 as of December 31, 2023. Our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Master Note Agreement is $900.0; however, none of the institutional investors party to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder. There is no amortization of these notes prior to their maturity date and interest is payable quarterly. The notes currently issued under our Master Note Agreement, including the maturity date and fixed interest rate per annum of each series of note, are contained in the table above. The Master Note Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants and we are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nFastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 68 Principal payments required on our outstanding indebtedness, based on the maturity dates defined within our long-term debt arrangements, for the succeeding five years, are displayed in the table below, as of December 31, 2023: Principal Payments 2024 $ 60.0 2025 75.0 2026 25.0 2027 50.0 2028 — 2029 and thereafter 50.0 Total $ 260.0 Note 10. Legal Contingencies We are involved in certain legal actions, including those that are ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. We record a liability for these legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. As of December 31, 2023, there were no litigation matters that we consider to be probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse outcome.\nNote 11. Subsequent Events We evaluated all subsequent event activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of the dividend declaration and stock option activities disclosed in Note 5.\n***End of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements*** Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 69 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Securities Exchange Act)). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The attestation report required under Item 9A is contained earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading 'Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. The company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. There was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ Daniel L.

The corporation may have other offices in such places within or outside of Minnesota as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.\nARTICLE II SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS Section 1. Place. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation, or at such other place within or outside of Minnesota as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation; provided, however, that any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the corporation is located. The Board of Directors may determine that shareholders not physically present in person or by proxy at a shareholder meeting may, by means of remote communication, participate in a shareholder meeting held at a designated place. The Board of Directors also may determine that a meeting of the shareholders shall not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by means of remote communication. Participation by remote communication constitutes presence at the meeting.\nSection 2. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the shareholders shall be held annually, as soon as convenient after the close of the preceding fiscal year of the corporation, at a time to be fixed by the Board of Directors, for the election of directors and the transaction of other appropriate business.\nSection 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time and for any purpose or purposes by a shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that purpose, must be called by twenty-five percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote) or by the Chair of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or two or more directors. The business transacted at a special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.\nSection 4. Notice. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of shareholders, stating the date, time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which it is called, shall be given to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. Notice to a shareholder is also effectively given if the notice is addressed to the shareholder or a group of shareholders in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), so long as the corporation has first received the written or implied consent required by those rules and regulations.\nSection 5. Waiver; Objections. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting, including attendance by means of remote communication, is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.\nSection 6. Quorum; Adjourned Meetings. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of shareholders originally present leaves less than a quorum. The Chair of any meeting of shareholders may adjourn the meeting, for any reason and whether or not a quorum is present, to a time and place announced at the time of adjournment, and no further notice of the adjourned meeting shall be required.\nExhibit 3.2 Section 7. Voting and Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, every owner of shares entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy and shall have one vote for each share held. In electing directors, the voting shall be by ballot. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote (a) by filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the corporation or the corporation's duly authorized agent at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original. Any shareholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors.\nSection 8. Chair of Meeting; Conduct of Meetings. The Chair of the Board shall preside at all meetings of shareholders. In his or her absence, the Board of Directors may appoint any other officer or director to act as Chair at the meeting. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate, or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the Chair of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such Chair are necessary, appropriate, or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the Chair shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants, regulation of the opening and closing of the polls, and restricting the use of cell phones, audio, or video recording devices and similar devices at the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the Chair, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. Section 9. Advance-Notice Requirements.\nSubdivision 1. Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with this Section 9 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures of this Section 9 or (iii) by any Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 10 below) who complies with the requirements of Section 10 below.\nSubdivision 2. Business Conducted at Meetings. The business conducted at any special meeting of shareholders of the corporation shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the special meeting pursuant to Section 3 of this Article II. At any regular meeting of shareholders of the corporation, the proposal of business (other than the nomination and election of directors, which shall be subject to Subdivision 1 of this Section 9) to be considered by the shareholders may be made (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of the meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures of this Section 9, or (iv) by a shareholder or group of shareholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nSubdivision 3. Timing and Content of Notice. (a) Timing of Notice. Timely written notice of a nomination or proposal pursuant to this Section 9 must be given to the General Counsel of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's written notice of nominations or of proposals, in each case to be made at a regular meeting of shareholders (other than business proposed pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act), must be delivered in writing to the General Counsel of the corporation, or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation, not less than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's regular meeting of shareholders. If, however, the date of the regular meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by a shareholder shall be timely only if so delivered or so mailed and received not less than 90 days before such regular meeting or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of the date of such regular meeting. If a special meeting of shareholders is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors, a shareholder’s written notice of nominations to be made at the special meeting of shareholders must be delivered in writing to the General Counsel of the corporation, or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation, not less than 90 days before the meeting (or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) the date of the meeting). Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the adjournment of a meeting of shareholders shall not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.\n(b) Content of Notice. A shareholder's notice to the corporation of nominations or of a proposal for a meeting of shareholders shall set forth: (x) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (i) such person's name, (ii) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or that is otherwise required, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, and (iii) such person's written consent to being named in any proxy materials as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (y) as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting (other than the nomination of a director): (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and (ii) any material interest in such business of the shareholder or any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (z) as to the shareholder giving the notice: (i) the name and address of such shareholder and of any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (ii) the class or series (if any) and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such shareholder or any such beneficial owner, (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into by, or on behalf of, such shareholder or any such beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk, or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of such shareholder or any such beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, (iv) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors (in the case of a nomination) or entitled to vote at the meeting (in the case of a shareholder proposal), will continue to be a holder of record of shares entitled to vote for the election of directors or at the meeting, as the case may be, through the date of the meeting, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice or to make the proposal, and (v) a representation whether the shareholder or any such beneficial owner intends or is part of a group that intends to deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding shares required to adopt the proposal (other than the nomination of a director) or otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of the proposal. A shareholder who intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the corporation's director nominees and who has delivered a notice of nomination pursuant to this Section 9 shall promptly certify to the corporation, and notify the corporation in writing, that it has complied with or will comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, and upon request of the corporation, shall, not later than five business days prior to the date of the applicable meeting of shareholders, deliver to the corporation reasonable evidence of such compliance.\nAt the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the General Counsel of the corporation all completed and signed questionnaires required of the corporation's directors and any other information required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice of nomination that pertains to a nominee.\n(c) Consequences of Failure to Give Timely Notice. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation and no business shall be conducted at any regular meeting except in accordance with this Section 9 or Section 10 below. The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance with this Section 9 or Section 10 below and, if the Chair should so determine, the Chair shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded or any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. The Chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 9 and, if the Chair so determines, the defective nomination shall be disregarded. Unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act and (ii) subsequently (A) notifies the corporation that such shareholder no longer intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the corporation's Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) director nominees in accordance with Rule 14a-19, (B) fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19, or (C) fails to provide reasonable evidence sufficient to satisfy the corporation that such requirements have been met, then such shareholder's nominations shall be deemed null and void and the corporation shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for any nominee proposed by such shareholder.\n(d) Inapplicable in Certain Circumstances. This Section 9 does not apply to any shareholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The requirements, procedures, and notice deadlines of Rule 14a-8 shall govern any proposal made pursuant thereto.\nSubdivision 4. Public Announcement. For purposes of this Section 9 and Section 10 below, \"public announcement\" means disclosure (i) when made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service, (ii) when filed in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) when mailed as the notice of the meeting pursuant to Section 4 of this Article II.\nSubdivision 5. Compliance with Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of Minnesota law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.\nSection 10.

Subject to the terms and conditions of these Bylaws, whenever the Board of Directors solicits proxies with respect to the election of directors at a regular meeting of shareholders, the corporation shall include in its proxy materials for such regular meeting, in addition to any persons nominated for election by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or otherwise pursuant to Section 9 of Article II, the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors delivered pursuant to this Section 10 (a \"Shareholder Nominee\") who satisfies the eligibility requirements herein (subject to the maximum number established pursuant to Subdivision 11, and who is identified in a timely and proper notice pursuant to Subdivision 6 that both complies with this Subdivision 1 (the \"Shareholder Notice\") and is given by a shareholder on behalf of one or more shareholders or beneficial owners that: (i) expressly elect at the time of the delivery of the Shareholder Notice to have such Shareholder Nominee included in the corporation's proxy materials for such regular meeting pursuant to this Subdivision 1; (ii) own and have Owned (as defined below) continuously for at least three (3) years a number of shares that represents at least three percent (3%) of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote in the election of directors (the \"Required Shares\") as of (i) the date on which the Shareholder Notice is delivered to the corporation at the principal executive offices and in accordance with this Subdivision 1, (ii) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the regular meeting, and (iii) the date of the regular meeting; and (iii) satisfy such additional requirements in these Bylaws (an \"Eligible Shareholder\").\nSubdivision 2. Eligible Shareholder. For purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder and satisfying the Ownership requirements under Subdivision 1: (a) The outstanding shares of common stock Owned by one or more shareholders and beneficial owners that each shareholder and/or beneficial owner has Owned continuously for at least three (3) years as of (i) the date on which the Shareholder Notice is delivered to the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation in accordance with this Section 10, (ii) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the regular meeting, and (iii) the date of the regular meeting may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and beneficial owners whose Ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20) and that any and all requirements and obligations for an Eligible Shareholder set forth in this Section 10 are satisfied by and as to each such shareholder and beneficial owner (except as noted with respect to aggregation or as otherwise provided in Subdivision 3); (b) For this purpose, two or more funds that are (i) under common management and investment control, (ii) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer, or (iii) a \"group of Exhibit 3.2 (Continued) investment companies,\" as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (each, a \"Qualifying Fund\"), shall be treated as one shareholder or beneficial owner; and (c) No shareholder or beneficial owner, alone or together with any of its affiliates, may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Subdivision 2. If a group of shareholders aggregates Ownership of shares in order to meet the requirements under this Subdivision 2, (i) all shares held by each shareholder constituting their contribution to the foregoing three percent (3%) threshold must have been held by that shareholder continuously for at least three (3) years and through the date of the regular meeting, and evidence of such continuous Ownership shall be provided as specified in Subdivision 5, (ii) each provision in this Section 10 that requires the Eligible Shareholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each shareholder (including each individual fund) that is a member of such group to provide such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate their shareholdings in order to meet the three percent (3%) Ownership requirement of the Required Shares definition), (iii) a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section 10 by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Shareholder and (iv) such Ownership shall be determined by aggregating the lowest number of shares continuously Owned by each such shareholder during the required holding period and the Shareholder Notice must indicate, for each such shareholder, such lowest number of shares continuously owned by such shareholder during such period.\nSubdivision 3.

Listing The Company's Common Stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol \"FAST.\" Anti-Takeover Provisions The Charter Documents and the MBCA contain certain provisions that may discourage an unsolicited takeover of the Company or make an unsolicited takeover of the Company more difficult. The following are some of the more significant anti-takeover provisions that are applicable to the Company: Business Combinations and Other Transactions with 15% Shareholders The Articles provide that, generally, (i) consolidations, mergers, statutory share exchanges and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the book value of the Company's assets involving a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (\"Voting Stock\"), (ii) the acquisition of assets from a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the Company's Voting Stock equal to or greater than 10% of the book value of the Company's assets, (iii) certain issuances of stock involving a beneficial holder of at least 15% of the Company's Voting Stock, (iv) liquidations or dissolutions of the Company proposed by or on behalf of a 15% or more beneficial shareholder, and (v) certain other specified transactions involving a 15% or more beneficial shareholder, whether or not they otherwise require a shareholder vote, require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Voting Stock, unless (a) the proposed transaction is first approved by a majority of the continuing directors (generally meaning any director whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the currently sitting directors) whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the continuing directors), or (b) the consideration to be received by the shareholders of the Company in the proposed transaction meets certain conditions generally designed to insure that shareholders receive a fair price for their shares, Exhibit 4.2 (Continued) and certain other procedural requirements in connection with the proposed transaction are followed. A 75% vote of the outstanding shares of the Company's Voting Stock is required to amend this special voting provision. Special Meetings of Shareholders; Shareholder Action by Unanimous Written Consent; and Advance Notice of Shareholder Business Proposals and Nominations Section 302A.433 of the MBCA provides that special meetings of the Company's shareholders may be called by the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, two or more directors, or shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote, except that a special meeting demanded by shareholders for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the board of directors for that purpose, must be called by 25% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote. Section 302A.441 of the MBCA also provides that action may be taken by shareholders without a meeting only by unanimous written consent. The By-Laws provide an advance written notice procedure with respect to shareholder proposals of business and shareholder nominations of candidates for election as directors. Shareholders at an annual meeting are able to consider only the proposals and nominations specified in the notice of meeting or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a shareholder that has delivered timely written notice in proper form to the Company's general counsel of the business to be brought before the meeting.\nControl Share Provision Section 302A.671 of the MBCA applies, with certain exceptions, to any acquisition of the Company's Voting Stock (from a person other than the Company and other than in connection with certain mergers and exchanges to which the Company is a party) resulting in the acquiring person owning 20% or more of the Company's Voting Stock then outstanding. Section 302A.671 requires approval of any such acquisitions by both (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, including shares held by the acquiring person, and (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, excluding all interested shares. In general, shares acquired in the absence of such approval are denied voting rights and are redeemable at their then fair market value by the Company within 30 days after the acquiring person has failed to give a timely information statement to the Company or the date the shareholders voted not to grant voting rights to the acquiring person's shares. The control share provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or in its bylaws approved by its shareholders. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nBusiness Combination Provision Section 302A.673 of the MBCA generally prohibits the Company or any of its subsidiaries from entering into any merger, share exchange, sale of material assets or similar transaction with a 10% shareholder within four years following the date the person became a 10% shareholder, unless either the transaction or the person's acquisition of shares is approved prior to the person becoming a 10% shareholder by a committee of all of the disinterested members of the board of directors. The business combination provision applies to any corporation that has not expressly provided to the contrary in its articles or its bylaws. The Articles provide that this provision shall apply.\nTakeover Offer; Fair Price Under Section 302A.675 of the MBCA, an offeror may not acquire shares of a publicly held corporation within two years following the last purchase of shares pursuant to a takeover offer with respect to that class, including acquisitions made by purchase, exchange, merger, consolidation, partial or complete liquidation, redemption, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, or any other similar transaction, unless (i) the acquisition is approved by a committee of the board's disinterested directors before the purchase of any shares by the offeror pursuant to the earlier takeover offer, or (ii) shareholders are afforded, at the time of the proposed acquisition, a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the shares to the offeror upon substantially equivalent terms as those provided in the earlier takeover offer.\nGreenmail Restrictions Under Section 302A.553 of the MBCA, a corporation is prohibited from buying shares at an above-market price from a greater than 5% shareholder who has held the shares for less than two years unless (i) the purchase is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote or (ii) the corporation makes an equal or better offer to all shareholders for all other shares of that class or series and any other class or series into which they may be converted.\nAuthority of the Board of Directors The Company's board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of the Company's capital stock, including the authority to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock, setting forth the designation of each such series and fixing the relative rights and preferences for each such series, without seeking shareholder approval in most instances. In addition, under the By-Laws, the Company's board of directors has the right to fill vacancies of the board of directors (including a vacancy created by an increase in the size of the board of directors).\nFastenal Company Bonus Program for Executive Officers Quarterly Incentives Our executive officers are eligible for cash incentives through individual bonus arrangements based on improvements in the overall financial performance of the company and/or their respective areas of responsibility. The bonus arrangements provide our executive officers with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus for each quarter during a year when we increase our earnings above a predetermined minimum target. The primary cash bonuses for all of our named executive officers are based on growth in pre-tax earnings of the company and/ or the officer's area of responsibility. The compensation committee selected pre-tax earnings as the appropriate metric for calculating cash bonuses for those officers because of the committee's belief that the focus of the named executive officers should be on profitability, which is the primary driver of shareholder value. The cash bonus for our chief financial officer also includes a component based on growth in company-wide net earnings because his responsibilities allow him to affect our entire financial position including our tax position. The compensation committee believes that no named executive officer should earn a cash bonus under this program for a quarter unless financial performance has improved and therefore sets minimum targets for each quarter that are equal to the earnings achieved for the same quarter in the prior year. The compensation committee requires growth in earnings before any bonuses can be earned due to its belief that growth is achievable with superior effort and will generate the cash necessary to expand the company's operations in accordance with our business plans and increase shareholder value. The payout percentage used to calculate the amount of each named executive officer's primary quarterly cash bonus reflects the officer's track record in his or her current position (i.e., newly promoted executives historically have had to prove themselves in their new positions before earning higher payout percentages) and relative ability to impact profitability.\nCash bonus payments to our named executive officers are tied directly to our financial performance so that they increase only if and to the extent the company's profitability grows; therefore, we do not believe it is necessary for payouts under our primary executive cash incentive program to be capped. We believe the current design of our executive bonus arrangements, along with our other controls, adequately mitigates risk and the use of multiple metrics would not be in furtherance of our goal of keeping our compensation programs simple, understandable, and transparent, and would risk keeping our executives focused on things other than profitability, thereby depriving them of the clear feedback and motivation necessary to improve our bottom line. Therefore, we do not base these cash incentives on multiple metrics. Our named executive officers are each eligible for a supplemental bonus program. The supplemental bonus program, known as the ROA (Return on Assets) Plan, is intended to encourage better management of accounts receivable, inventory, and vehicles and provides cash incentive amounts on a quarterly basis for asset management improvement over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and is described in more detail below. Exhibit 10.1 2023 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2023 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2022. Consistent with prior years, the bonuses for 2023 were based on growth in pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility. The bonuses for each quarter were determined by applying a payout percentage to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings exceeded 100% of pre-tax earnings or net earnings for the same quarter in 2022. The compensation committee determined that the payout percentages for each of the named executive officers for 2023 would remain unchanged from those in effect at the end of 2022, except that Mr. Lewis' bonus arrangement was updated to include a component for growth in pre-tax earnings, in addition to growth in net earnings. In May 2023, when Mr. Watts was appointed to Chief Sales Officer, his bonus arrangement was updated to reflect growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings. Prior to May 2023, his bonus arrangement included growth in pre-tax earnings of our international business units and a smaller component of company-wide pre-tax growth.\nThe specific bonus opportunities for our named executive officers are summarized in the table below. Each named executive officer's cash bonus for each quarter during 2023 was determined by applying the payout percentage listed opposite his or her name below to the amount by which pre-tax earnings or net earnings of the company and/or the officer's area of responsibility for that quarter exceeded 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022 (the 'minimum target'). Name Earnings Type Payout Percentage Mr. Florness Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.75% Mr. Lewis Company-wide pre-tax earnings / Company-wide net earnings 0.50% / 0.35% Mr. Miller (1) Pre-tax earnings 1.00% / 0.25% Mr. Watts (2) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% Mr. Soderberg Company-wide pre-tax earnings 0.65% Mr. Owen (3) Company-wide pre-tax earnings 1.00% (1) The bonuses for Mr. Miller were based on growth in pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (Eastern United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 1.00%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.25%.\n(2) Prior to May 2023, the bonuses for Mr. Watts were based on growth in company-wide pre-tax earnings for the geographic areas under his leadership (which were all areas outside of the United States), with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 2.20%, as well as growth in company pre-tax earnings, with the payout percentage applied to that growth of 0.30%. (3) Mr. Owen resigned on October 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets out, for each quarter in 2023, our actual and minimum target pre-tax earnings and net earnings on a company-wide basis for that quarter, in each case rounded to the nearest thousand. (As indicated above, the 'minimum target' amount in 2023 was 100% of such earnings in the same quarter of 2022.) 2023 Actual Pre-tax Earnings Minimum Target Pre-tax Earnings Actual Net Earnings Minimum Target Net Earnings First quarter $ 389,734,000 $ 355,714,000 $ 295,139,000 $ 269,588,000 Second quarter 392,640,000 380,745,000 298,050,000 287,102,000 Third quarter 385,389,000 375,316,000 295,367,000 284,595,000 Fourth quarter 354,226,000 328,177,000 266,429,000 245,606,000 During 2023, the approximate percentage of the actual and minimum pre-tax earnings of the company attributable to our operations in the geographic area under Mr. Miller's leadership was 47% and Mr. Watts' leadership through April was 13%. As noted above, the ROA Plan, which is designed to encourage careful management of assets, namely accounts receivable, inventories, and pick-up trucks, for 2023 was approved by the compensation committee for our named executive officers. Quarterly bonuses would be payable pursuant to the ROA Plan if a specified level of improvement in asset management relative to the comparable prior year quarter was achieved. Improvement in asset management was assessed using a two-quarter average of total assets divided by the trailing 12-month net sales, which we refer to as the 'performance percentage.' If the performance percentage when compared to the prior year benchmark showed improvement at a level specified in the table below, the named executive officer would receive the corresponding bonus amount. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout 150 basis points $ 15,000 100 basis points (but less than 150 basis points) $ 10,000 50 basis points (but less than 100 basis points) $ 5,000 In addition, for each whole percentage improvement (e.g., 41.0%, 40.0%, 39.0%, etc.) a $10,000 bonus would be payable for the quarter when the new whole percentage threshold was first achieved. We achieved improvement and paid bonus amounts to our named executive officers, pursuant to the ROA Plan for each quarter in fiscal 2023 as follows: 2023 Improvement Amount Exceeded Bonus Payout First quarter 150 basis points $ 15,000 Second quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Third quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter 150 basis points 15,000 Fourth quarter Whole percentage improvement (38.0% and 37.0%) 20,000 Total $ 80,000 2024 Incentive Program The bonus arrangements for our named executive officers for 2024 were approved by our compensation committee at its last meeting in 2023. The bonus plans for our named executive officers for 2024 are unchanged from our 2023 bonus plans, except that Mr. Miller's payout percentage on pretax earnings will decrease beginning in the third quarter of 2024 while the geographic area that his bonus will be based on (United States) will increase. Exhibit 10.1 (Continued) Exhibit 10.2 FASTENAL COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (As amended and restated effective April 24, 2018) This Plan is adopted and made by Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation with principal offices at Winona, Minnesota (the \"Company\"), for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 1. Purpose.\nThe Fastenal Company Stock Option Plan (the \"Plan\") is intended to advance the interests of the Company, its shareholders, and its subsidiaries by encouraging and enabling selected employees upon whose judgment, initiative and effort the Company and its subsidiaries are dependent for the successful conduct of their business, to acquire and retain a proprietary interest in the Company by ownership of its Shares. All Options granted under the Plan and all Shares sold upon exercise of Options are granted and sold by the Company. Options granted under the Plan will not be options that meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"). 2. Definitions.\n(a) \"Administrator\" means the body administering the Plan, as specified in Section 9. (b) \"Board\" means the Board of Directors of the Company. (c) \"Cause\" means (i) any failure by an Optionee to materially conform to the Company's Standards of Conduct; (ii) an Optionee's continued failure or refusal to perform his or her duties to Company or any Subsidiary (except when prevented by reason of illness, disability or approved leave of absence); (iii) an Optionee willfully engaging in conduct that is, in the good faith judgment of the Board or Administrator, demonstrably and materially detrimental to the Company or any Subsidiary, financially, reputationally, or otherwise; (iv) an illegal or negligent act by an Optionee that adversely affects the Company or any Subsidiary in a material way; or (v) conviction of an Optionee of a felony involving moral turpitude. For purposes of this Plan, if an Optionee's termination of employment occurs for any reason other than Cause, and the Company thereafter discovers additional facts that the Company was not aware of as of the date of termination that would have justified a termination of employment for Cause, and if the Administrator provides the Optionee with written notice stating the newly discovered facts that support a termination for Cause within 90 days after the applicable date of termination, then the Optionee's termination of employment will be deemed for all purposes under this Plan to be a termination of employment for Cause.\n(d) \"Company\" means Fastenal Company, a Minnesota corporation, and any successor corporation. (e) \"Common Stock\" means the Company's $.01 par value Common Stock. (f) \"Date of Grant\" means the date on which the Administrator approves the grant of an Option under the Plan, or such later date as may be specified by the Administrator on the date the Administrator approves the grant.

(h) \"Fair Market Value\" on any date means the per share closing price or last sale price at which Shares were traded on that date or, if no sale of Shares occurred on that date, on the next preceding day on which a sale of Shares occurred, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or such other recognized national securities exchange on which the Shares are then listed and traded. If the Common Stock is not then listed and traded upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall be what the Administrator determines in good faith to be 100% of the fair market value of a Share as of the date in question. This determination by the Administrator shall be binding upon the Optionee and all other persons. (i) \"Option\" means an Option granted under the Plan. (j) \"Option Price\" means the purchase price for each Share subject to an Option as specified in paragraph 6(a) of the Plan. (k) \"Optionee\" means a person to whom an Option, which has not expired, has been granted under the Plan. (l) \"Permitted Transfer\" means a transfer of a Right by will or the laws of descent and distribution. (m) \"Retirement\" means any termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than for Cause, occurring at or after age 60, or at or after completing 25 years or more of continuous employment with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. (n) \"Shares\" shall mean shares of Common Stock, or such other securities or property as may become subject to Options pursuant to an adjustment as provided under Section 7 of the Plan. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (o) \"Subsidiary\" or \"Subsidiaries\" means a subsidiary corporation or corporations of the Company as defined in Section 424 of the Code. (p) \"Successor\" means the legal representative of the estate of a deceased Optionee or the person or persons who acquire the right to exercise an Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of any Optionee. 3. Shares Subject to Options.\nThe aggregate number of authorized and unissued Shares for which Options may be granted and which may be purchased upon the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 11,462,020, subject to adjustment under the provisions of paragraph 7. In the event any Option shall, for any reason, terminate or expire or be surrendered without having been exercised in full, other Options may be granted covering the Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option. The maximum number of Shares subject to Options that may be granted to any one individual under this Plan during any fiscal year of the Company (the \"Maximum Annual Grant\") is 500,000 Shares, subject to adjustment under the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan. 4. Participants.\nAll employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, subject to any criteria, categories, or limitations that may be established by the Administrator from time to time. Criteria for participation may reflect an employee's contribution to the success of the Company, including the employee's responsibility for Company revenues and profits, responsibility for managing other employees, possession of special skills, and length of service. The Administrator shall determine participation, grant Options, and specify the number of Shares subject to each Option. 5. Grant of Options.\nOptions shall be granted to employees eligible to participate in the Plan at such times and in such amounts, consistent with the Plan, as may be determined by the Administrator, as long as Shares remain available for award under the Plan, or until the Plan is terminated as provided herein. 6. Terms and Conditions of Options. All Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement or certificate in such form and with such terms, including any conditions as to exercisability, as the Administrator may from time to time approve consistent with the Plan, subject to the following limitations and conditions: (a) Option Price. The purchase price of each Share subject to an Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant, but shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. (b) Period of Option. The expiration date with respect to each Option shall be determined and stated by the Administrator at the time of grant. (c) Vesting of Shareholder Rights. Neither an Optionee nor any transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company until the Option has been exercised and the Shares purchased are properly issued to such Optionee or transferee. (d) Exercise of Option. The date or dates at which each Option will become exercisable and the period during which such Option may be exercised shall be determined and stated by the Administrator in the award agreement or certificate at the time of grant. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, an Option may be exercised only while the Optionee is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, and only if the Optionee has been continuously so employed since the date the Option was granted. (e) Manner of Exercise. Each exercise of an Option shall be in writing, in such form as the Administrator may prescribe, delivered to the Administrator or its designee, specifying the number of Shares being purchased and accompanied by payment of the Option Price for such Shares, by check payable to the Company or in such other manner as the Administrator may prescribe. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (f) Nontransferability of Options. No Option shall be transferable or assignable by an Optionee otherwise than by a Permitted Transfer. Each Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. No Option shall be pledged or hypothecated in any way and no Option shall be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. Any Option held by a transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such Option immediately prior to its transfer and may be exercised by such transferee as and to the extent that such Option has become exercisable and has not terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the applicable award agreement or certificate. For purposes of any provision of this Plan relating to notice to an Optionee or to the exercisability or termination of an option upon or following the death, disability or termination of employment of an Optionee, the references to \"Optionee\" shall mean the original grantee of an Option and not any transferee. (g) Termination of Employment. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 6(h), 6(i) or 6(j), upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of such termination of employment, and shall to that extent remain exercisable until the earlier of 90 days after the date of such termination of employment or the expiration date of such Option. The granting of an Option to an Optionee does not alter in any way the existing rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries to terminate such person's employment at any time for any reason or for no reason, nor does it confer upon such person any rights or privileges except as specifically provided for in the Plan. (h) Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, then: (1) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted prior to January 1, 2012 shall terminate except to the extent that it is immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of Optionee's death, and shall to that extent remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the earlier of 13 months after the date of Optionee's death or the expiration date of such Option. (2) Any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement or certificate following the Optionee's death, and shall remain exercisable by the Optionee's Successor until the expiration date of such Option.\n(i) Retirement of Optionee. If an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates due to Retirement, then any outstanding Option held by such Optionee that was granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall, subject to the following sentence, terminate except to the extent that it is vested and immediately exercisable by its terms at the date of the Optionee's Retirement, and shall to the extent vested remain exercisable until the expiration date of such Option. With respect to any Option granted on or after January 1, 2012, the Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to provide in the applicable award agreement or certificate, either at the time the Option is granted or by amendment to such award agreement or certificate while the Option is outstanding, for the accelerated or continued vesting of such Option upon or following Retirement. (j) Termination for Cause. Upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for Cause, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited. (k) Forfeiture For Breach of Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, if an Optionee who is party to a non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary violates any such agreement in any material respect, any outstanding Option held by such Optionee shall immediately terminate and be forfeited, and with respect to any exercise of an Option by such Optionee within a 12 month period prior to the occurrence of such violation, the Optionee shall be liable to the Company for the difference between the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Shares acquired upon such exercise and the aggregate exercise price of such Shares. The Optionee shall pay such amount promptly upon demand by the Company. (l) Demotion or Reassignment of Optionee. If at any time before an outstanding Option becomes fully exercisable the Optionee holder of such Option is transferred or reassigned to a position within the Company or any Subsidiary in which, had the Optionee been assigned to such position as of the Date of Grant of such Option, the Optionee would not have been entitled, under the Option award guidelines then being applied by the Administrator, to receive an Option award covering as many Shares as were made subject to the Option actually issued (a \"Demotion\"), then a portion (or all) of the Option will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion determined as follows: Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (1) if no portion of the outstanding Option has become exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then the portion of the Option that will be forfeited as of the effective date of the Demotion shall be equal to the difference between the number of Shares as granted to the Optionee on the Date of Grant and the number of Shares that would have been granted had the Optionee been assigned to such new position as of the Date of Grant under the Option award guidelines then applied by the Administrator. The Option will become exercisable as to the remaining Shares that are not forfeited on a pro rata basis in accordance with the original exercisability schedule; or (2) if a portion of the outstanding Option was exercisable prior to the effective date of the Demotion, then it will remain exercisable during the remaining term of the Option, but the portion of the Option not yet exercisable as of the effective date of the Demotion will be forfeited by the Optionee on the effective date of the Demotion consistent with Section 6(l)(i) above. 7. Adjustments. (a) Except as provided in paragraph 7(c), in the event of a capital adjustment resulting from a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, or a combination or exchange of Shares, the number and kind of Shares subject to the Plan and the Maximum Annual Grant and the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable shall be adjusted consistent with such capital adjustment. The Option price of any Share under each outstanding Option shall be adjusted so that there will be no change in the aggregate purchase price payable upon exercise of the unexercised portion of such Option. The granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reorganizations, reclassifications, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. (b) In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time. (c) In the event of a Reorganization (as hereinafter defined) in which the Company is not the surviving or acquiring company, or in which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization, then: (1) If there is no plan or agreement respecting the Reorganization (\"Reorganization Agreement\") or if the Reorganization Agreement does not specifically provide for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then any Option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Administrator, provided that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right during such period (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the applicable Option) to exercise each of his outstanding Options as to all or any part of the Shares covered thereby including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable by reason of an insufficient passage of time; or (2) If there is a Reorganization Agreement and if the Reorganization Agreement specifically provides for the change, conversion, or exchange of the Shares under outstanding and unexercised Options for securities of another corporation, then the securities received on account of such Shares shall be subject to the Plan and then-outstanding Options. The Administrator may make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares for the purchase of which Options may be granted under the Plan and for the Maximum Annual Grant. In addition, the Administrator shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end that the interest of the holder of the Option shall, to the extent practicable, be maintained as before the occurrence of such event. Such adjustment in outstanding Options shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Option but with a corresponding adjustment in the Option price per Share. The term \"Reorganization\" as used in this paragraph (c) of this Section 7 shall mean any statutory merger, statutory consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale, pursuant to an agreement with the Company, of securities of the Company pursuant to which the Company is or becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company after the effective date of the Reorganization. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) (d) Adjustments and determinations under this Section 7 shall be made by the Administrator as specified herein, and its decisions as to what adjustments or determinations shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 8. Restrictions on Issuing Shares. The exercise of each Option and the issuance of Shares in connection therewith shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the Administrator shall determine in its discretion that the satisfaction of withholding tax or other withholding liabilities, or that the listing, registration, or qualification of any Shares otherwise deliverable upon such exercise upon the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other recognized national securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or that the consent or approval of any regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, such exercise or the delivery or purchase of Shares pursuant thereto, then in any such event, such exercise shall not be effective unless such withholding, listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Administrator. 9. Administration of Plan. (a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board or by a committee of two or more directors of the Company appointed by the Board (the \"Administrator\"). If the Plan is administered by a committee, it shall report all actions taken by it to the Board. In administering the Plan, the Administrator shall be governed by and shall adhere to the provisions of the Plan, including any criteria for eligibility or participation established by the Board from time to time. Subject to the foregoing, the Administrator shall determine eligibility to participate in the Plan, ascertain the number of Shares for which each participant is eligible in accordance with any established criteria, grant Options, construe and interpret the Plan, and make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. All such actions and determinations shall be conclusively binding for all purposes and upon all persons. The Administrator may delegate administrative authority under this Plan to such officers or employees of the Company or others as it may determine, except that any authority so delegated shall not extend to granting and administering awards to persons who are then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Options granted to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are intended to be granted either by the Board or by a committee composed entirely of \"non-employee directors\" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and \"outside directors\" as defined in and in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code. (b) To the greatest extent permitted by law, (i) no member or former member of the Administrator shall be liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan, and (ii) the members or former members of the Administrator shall be entitled to indemnification by the Company against and from any loss incurred by such members by reason of any such actions and determinations. 10. Delivery of Shares and Proceeds. Upon the exercise of an Option, the Administrator shall cause the purchased Shares to be issued by the Company's transfer agent and a certificate or statement of issuance to be delivered to the Optionee. The proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall be the property of the Company, and shall be delivered to it promptly by the Administrator. 11. Amendment, Suspension, or Termination of Plan.\nThe Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan or may amend it from time to time in such respects as it may deem advisable in order that the Options granted thereunder may conform to any changes in the law or in any other respect which it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company. Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate when all available Shares have been granted and no granted Option is outstanding. No Option may be granted during any suspension or after the termination of the Plan. No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall, without an Optionee's consent, impair any of the rights or obligations under any outstanding Option theretofore granted to such Optionee under the Plan. An Optionee's consent to any amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan or to any Option issued pursuant to the Plan shall be deemed to have been given if the Optionee fails to object in writing within 15 days after written notice thereof, given in person or by certified mail sent to the Optionee's address contained in the records of the Company. To the extent considered necessary to comply with applicable provisions of law or the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other applicable recognized national securities exchange, any such amendments to the Plan may be made subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company. Exhibit 10.2 (Continued) 12. Adoption and Effective Date of Plan. The Plan was originally approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2003, and approved by the shareholders of the Company on April 15, 2003. Amendments to the Plan incorporated in this document were approved by the Board of Directors on January 18, 2007, and became effective upon approval by the shareholders of the Company on April 17, 2007.

Florness Holden Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Executive Officer) (Principal Financial Officer) FASTENAL COMPANY COMPENSATION FORFEITURE, RECOVERY AND TRUE-UP POLICY (Adopted October 11, 2023) Policy The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Fastenal Company (the \"Company\") has adopted this Compensation Forfeiture and Recovery Policy (this \"Policy\") pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, upon a Recoupment Event, each Covered Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company, reasonably promptly, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was received by such Covered Executive during the Lookback Period. In addition, to the extent that the Company underpaid incentive compensation due to inaccurate financial statements, Covered Executives will be reimbursed for the difference.\nAdministration This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\"). Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nDefinitions \"Accounting Restatement\" means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that (a) is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a \"Big R\" restatement) or (b) would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a \"little r\" restatement).\n\"Covered Executive\" means each of the Company's current and former Section 16 Officers.\n\"Erroneously Awarded Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the excess of the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period over the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\n\"Financial Reporting Measures\" are any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n\"Incentive-Based Compensation\" is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n\"Lookback Period\" means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company's fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nA \"Recoupment Event\" occurs when the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Required Restatement Date\" means the earlier to occur of: (x) the date the Company's Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n\"Section 16 Officer\" is defined as an \"officer\" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act.\n\"Section 409A\" means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.\nExhibit 97 \"True-Up Compensation\" means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, any additional amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period, had the Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated financial statements.\nAmount Subject to Recovery The Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy includes such compensation that is received by a Covered Executive (i) on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded or granted prior to this date), (ii) after the individual began service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if the individual served as a Section 16 Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation, and (iv) while the Company is publicly traded.\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery from a Covered Executive upon a Recoupment Event is the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which amount shall be determined by the Committee.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nRecovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation Promptly following a Recoupment Event, the Committee will determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive, and the Company will provide each such Covered Executive with a written notice of such amount and a demand for repayment or return. Upon receipt of such notice, each affected Covered Executive shall promptly repay or return such Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company. If the Covered Executive repays, chooses to forfeit, or returns Erroneously Awarded Compensation within a reasonable period of time (generally not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of notification from the Company or as otherwise agreed to by the Company), the Covered Executive may elect to repay, forfeit or return the Erroneously Awarded Compensation by timely: (i) transferring funds to the Company, (ii) forfeiting any compensation that is not yet payable; or (iii) forfeiting stock options that the Covered Executive has received from the Company, whether vested or unvested, with an equivalent value to the Erroneously Award Compensation. If the Covered Executive does not timely repay, forfeit or return Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Company shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method determined by the Committee, provided that recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be made in compliance with Section 409A. The applicable Covered Executive shall also be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses (including legal fees) reasonably incurred by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\nLimited Exceptions Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be recovered in accordance with this Policy unless the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions is met: • the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, provided the Company has first made a reasonable effort to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation; or • the recovery would likely cause a U.S. tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\nReliance on any of the above exemptions will further comply with applicable listing standards, including without limitation, documenting the reason for the impracticability and providing required documentation to Nasdaq.\nNo Insurance or Indemnification The Company will not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (or related expenses incurred by the Covered Executive) pursuant to a recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy, nor will it pay or reimburse a Covered Executive for any insurance premiums on any insurance policy obtained by the Covered Executive to protect against the forfeiture or recovery of any compensation pursuant to this Policy.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Additional Incentive Compensation Due to a Covered Executive In the event of an Accounting Restatement, any True-Up Compensation due to a Covered Executive during the Look-Back Period will be paid to the Covered Executive as soon as practicable, but not later than the March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the Accounting Restatement was complete. The amount of any True-Up Compensation shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. However, in any payment of any True-Up Compensation must comply with Section 409A; in the event that a payment otherwise due under this Policy would not be in compliance with Section 409A, the amount will be forfeited. In addition, in no event whatsoever shall the Company or its officers, directors, employees or agents be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Executive by Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.\nInterpretation The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy shall be applied and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10D-1 and any applicable regulations, rules or standards adopted by SEC or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. In the event that this Policy does not meet the requirements of Rule 10D-1, the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed, this Policy shall be deemed to be amended to meet such requirements.\nAmendment; Termination The Board or the Committee may amend this Policy in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with the regulations adopted by the SEC under Rule 10D-1 and the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed. The Board or the Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if that amendment or termination would cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company's securities are listed.\nOther Recoupment Rights Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar provision in any compensation plan agreement, and any other legal remedies available to the Company. This Policy is in addition to any other clawback or compensation recovery, recoupment or forfeiture policy that may be adopted by the Company from time to time, or any laws, rules or listing standards applicable to the Company, including without limitation, the Company's right to recoup compensation subject to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but shall supersede and replace in its entirety the Company's existing Executive Incentive Recoupment Policy adopted by the Board in 2016. To the extent that application of this Policy would provide for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that the Company recovers pursuant to another policy or provision, the amount that is recovered will be credited to the required recovery under this Policy.\nSuccessors This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nExhibit 97 (Continued) Annual Meeting The annual meeting of shareholders will be at 10:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, on Thursday, April 25, 2024, at the Remlinger Muscle Car Museum located at 3560 Service Drive, Winona, Minnesota.\nHome Office Fastenal Company 2001 Theurer Boulevard Winona, Minnesota 55987-0978 Phone: 507-454-5374 I Fax: 507-453-8049 Legal Counsel Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota Form 10-K A copy of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is available without charge to shareholders upon written request to Investor Relations at the address of our home office listed on this page.

Please send updates/corrections to editor@mdm.com .\n© 2024 Modern Distribution Management. All rights reserved.\n3 2024 MDM Top Distributors Lists Latest updates at mdm.com/top_distributors Continued on next page Normalization and Tougher Comparables Welcome to Modern Distribution Management’s 2024 Top Distributors feature, now in its 15th year. Here, you’ll find our rankings of North America’s largest distributors of industrial, commercial and building supply products, based on their 2023 fiscal revenue within 20 different industry verticals. More than 200 different companies are represented across these various lists.\nIt’s MDM’s biggest research project of the year.\nBefore you dive into our rankings in the pages ahead, let's set the stage for the key factors that shaped this year’s feature and key context you should know when perusing our lists.\n2023: Strong Start, Late Fade Since our lists are based purely on 2023 fiscal rev-enues for all distributors, that year is worth examining from a high level.\nAfter riding the inflation wave in 2021 and 2022, distributors found 2023 to be less advantageous from an economic tailwind perspective. While inflation persisted throughout 2023 and has since, it leveled out throughout the year and led to far tougher year-over-year financial comparables. Meanwhile, publicly-traded distributors began to mention demand softening as early as 1Q23 quarterly earnings reports, with that ramping up as the year progressed.\nDisinflation and lower volumes resulted in the U.S. wholesale distribution sector finishing with 2023 annual revenues of $7.887 trillion, according to the MDM Forecast, which strips out agents and brokers, manufac-turers' sales branches and offices, importers and export-ers. That was down 1.8% after soaring 14.8% and 20.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSource: MDM Forecast But, it’s important to keep in mind the context that while 2023 was a downstep in overall revenue, that was compared to a record-setting and inflated previous two years. Far removed from direct impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2023 may be remembered as the first ‘normal’ year since 2019 in terms of supply chain con-ditions and escalating inflation.\nThe vast majority of the distributors on our lists posted modest annual sales gains or declines in 2023, while pockets of others outperformed their competition or were hit hard by market-specific factors. That’s continued through the first half of 2024, with firms still facing tough comps vs. the first and second quarters of a year earlier. Industry-Specific Revenue Like for the past several years, this is the most import-ant part of this introduction. Starting in 2022, MDM put a heightened emphasis on ranking companies by their sector-specific revenues rather than total revenue.\nThis also explains why you’ll see some distributors with smaller total revenues ranked higher than others within the same industry.\nTake Grainger, for example. By its total 2023 reve-nue of $16.5 billion, Grainger is North America’s largest industrial supplies distributor. But when digging into its financial reports and product sector breakouts, we find that it’s also one of North America’s top distributors of electrical, HVACR, plumbing, power transmission, fluid power and safety products. This is why Grainger ended up appearing on 10 of our 20 sector lists — the company’s revenue within each of those segments is large enough to warrant a spot. And this is why Watsco is ranked No. 1 in HVACR and Grainger is No. 5 despite Watsco’s $7.3 bil-lion in 2023 revenue being much smaller than Grainger’s $16.5 billion — Watsco’s HVACR revenue was much high-er than Grainger’s.\nThis explains why you’ll find some companies chart-ed on industry lists outside of their “core” offering. For example, Graybar is best known as an electrical products distributor, but its industrial products sales were large emough to chart at No. 20 on our Industrial Supplies list. It’s also why Ferguson appears on our lists for Industrial Supplies, Building Materials/Construction and Safety, besides its hallmarks of Plumbing, HVACR and Industrial PVF.\nBut while our rankings are based on 2023 revenue within each sector, the revenue you see displayed on our lists is overall revenue. Why? Quite simply, while many privately-owned distributors elected not to publicly share their total revenues, far fewer still elected not to publicly share their sector-specific revenues. If we displayed the sector-specific revenues of those that gave us the OK to, they’d be few and far between. The overall revenue figure gives us something to show for the majority of companies on our lists.\nThat sector-specific revenue breakout is the most painstaking part of our research process, as it involves an incredible amount of hair-splitting and triangulation to find accurate revenues. It makes this feature all the more challenging, but we do it because it results in a more accu-rate list and levels the playing field. © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

For distributors that don’t follow a January-December fiscal calendar, we’ve noted that with an asterisk and a footnote. To normalize the way we display the rankings, we include total company revenues, rather than break out individual sector revenues. Companies were asked to provide data about revenues, with information sup-plemented by quarterly fiscal reports, SEC filings and publicly available information. For companies that elect to not share revenue data, MDM estimates their relative po-sition in its sector list based on the best available industry resources and information. Note: Companies that operate primarily as master distributors are not eligible for Top Distributors inclusion. 3 New List Segments With the support from MDM’s integration into the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, we were able to add three list cagories to our feature — Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare, Food & Beverage and Lubricants & Fuels. This expansion helps our feature rep-resent even more of the wholesale distribution industry. Where's Amazon Business?\nMDM readers who have regularly seen our Top Distributors lists over the years may notice that we don’t include the industry’s biggest elephant in the room: Amazon Business. The B2B supplies marketplace ap-peared in the top six of our Industrial Supplies list since first appearing in 2018, including at No. 2 in 2022. While the platform is certainly competing directly with indus-trial, commercial and building supply distributors for market share to a tune of $35 billion in 2022 revenue, we made the decision last year to omit it from our lists due to Amazon Business’ very unique business model. It was the only company on our lists in previous years that couldn’t be described as a distributor. We do, however, include The Home Depot’s Pro segment, which directly operates via distribution sales, services and logistics. To Keep in Mind As you peruse the rankings across these different verticals, it’s important to remember that the way we put them together is not an exact science. While our editorial team made every effort to extract revenue information from the non-publicly-traded distributors listed here, many companies are understandably private with that information. We are happy to keep that revenue informa-tion strictly private and only use it internally for rankings, which an increasing number of companies opt for each year. So, when you see “N/A” listed for revenue, that likely means that revenue figure was confidentially given to MDM and to not be published.\nEven with that understanding, a smaller number of companies would rather not budge on sharing their revenue. Given the amount of large distributors that have been privately-acquired in recent years, this isn’t a sur-prise. In these cases where revenue isn’t shared, our team triangulates with respected industry experts and the best available information to estimate and rank distributors appropriately.\nAnother nugget to note is that since we used fiscal 2023 revenues for all companies, the revenues of handful of companies that don’t follow a traditional 12-month fiscal calendar represent a time difference by as much as nine months. We’ve denoted distributors that don’t follow a traditional fiscal calendar with an asterisk next to their revenue and a footnote. Questions? Comments?\nAs alluded to above, there is no perfect way to conduct these rankings. I’m sure there are MDM readers who will disagree with where and how certain companies are slotted on our list, and that’s OK, especially given our focus on sector-specific revenue. I’m very open to comments and suggestions for how we can improve this feature going forward.

While every MRO product may be considered an industrial product, the opposite isn’t always true. For MDM, MRO products are those needed to keep a company’s facilities and production processes running smoothly, whereas industrial products encompass MRO in addition to products involved in the manufacturing process and/or components used in the final product.\n*MSC's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 *Applied's 2023 fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 © 2024 Modern Distribution Management.

It consists of companies that purchase products from manufacturers, like tools, machines, and safety equipment. These products allow a range of industries, for example, construction and factories, to perform their work. The industrial distribution market is expanding partly due to increasing industrialization, demand for rapid shipping, smart technology, and a more innovative supply chain.\n\nThe distributors make sure the product gets from the warehouse to the truck, to the facility, through a combination of warehouse space, trucks, and software methods. Examples of distributors are Motion Industries, Fastenal, and W.W. Grainger. With the increase in different industries and the increase in their respective volume, the need for a distributor is critical and will become more important.

  "reasoning": "I used the supplied corporate filings and industry reports (Grainger 2023 10-K, Fastenal 2023 annual material, MSC investor pages, MDM Top Distributors 2024 lists, Statifacts market databook) to build a sector-level Porter’s Five Forces analysis for U.S. General Industrial Supplies (MRO/industrial distribution). Key evidence used: scale and dual business models at Grainger and Fastenal (high-touch + endless/e-commerce), public revenues and network scale (Grainger $16.5B, Fastenal ~$7.4B, MSC ~$4B), Heavy growth in managed inventory (FMI), vending and onsite services, distribution center automation and LIFT concepts, supplier concentration in Asia for many components (fasteners), elevated but moderating input cost volatility (2021–23 commodity/import shipping inflation then disinflation), buyer consolidation (national accounts, procurement platforms), and rising digital channel competition (eCommerce penetration & platform players). I balanced qualitative factors (service differentiation, long-term local networks, supplier/geopolitical risk) and quantitative signals (industry growth projections in Statifacts/MDM and revenue patterns) to evaluate each force, estimate overall attractiveness, and produce pragmatic strategic recommendations for incumbents and potential entrants.",

Overall threat levels are mixed: new digital entrants lower some barriers, but the cost of achieving nationwide/local rapid fulfillment, technical sales and integrated services keeps true parity with incumbents difficult. Suppliers exert medium power; buyers are increasingly powerful where national account consolidation and eProcurement exist, but sticky managed‑inventory relationships raise switching costs for many customers. Competitive rivalry is high and will remain intense as incumbents pursue omni‑channel service, automation and M&A. Industry attractiveness is moderate — steady demand and digital tailwinds are balanced by margin pressure and capital needs. Incumbents should emphasize differentiated service, supply resilience, digital integration, and selective tuck‑ins; potential entrants should focus on niche specialization, digital efficiency, and strategic partnerships rather than attempting a broad national footprint quickly."
