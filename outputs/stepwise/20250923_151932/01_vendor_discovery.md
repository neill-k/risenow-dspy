## Key evaluation criteria (score each vendor 1–5)
- ServiceNow & Core ITSM integration depth (CMDB, incidents, changes, requests)
- Automation / Auto‑resolution rate (metrics, customer references)
- Channel support (Slack, Teams, email, portal, mobile, voice)
- Identity & access: SSO (SAML/OIDC/Azure AD), MFA support, user context enrichment
- Security & compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP — vendor-provided evidence)
- Data residency & retention controls (ability to restrict data locations, purge logs)
- LLM/model governance (private models, fine‑tuning, hallucination mitigation, system prompts)
- Deployment options (SaaS, VPC, private cloud, on‑prem)
- Extensibility & APIs (webhooks, REST/graph APIs, orchestration)
- Observability & analytics (resolution metrics, intent drift, ROI dashboards)
- Time to pilot / production and implementation effort
- Total cost of ownership (license + implementation + token/usage fees + support)

Suggested scoring weights: prioritize ServiceNow integration, automation rates, security/compliance, channel support, and LLM governance for enterprise IT.

---

## Recommended RFP / discovery questions
1. Describe your ITSM integrations (ServiceNow, Jira Service Management, Freshservice): which versions, level of integration (create/update tickets, map fields, CMDB sync, workflows)?
2. Provide measured automation/auto‑resolution metrics from customer deployments (use cases, % tickets auto‑resolved, reduction in MTTR).
3. What channels are supported out-of-the-box? (Slack, Teams, email, portal, mobile, voice) Provide integration examples.
4. Deployment options: SaaS, VPC, private cloud, on‑prem. Can you support US data residency?
5. List security/compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP, others). Provide whitepapers or audit evidence.
6. How do you handle identity, authentication and authorization? (SSO, SAML/OIDC, attribute enrichment, RBAC)
7. Who hosts the LLMs? Do you use third‑party models (OpenAI/GCP/Azure) or proprietary models? Options for private/fine‑tuned models?
8. Data handling: retention defaults, data used for model training, ability to opt‑out, encryption at rest/in transit.
9. Describe escalation/handoff logic to human agents and how context is preserved across channels and tickets.
10. Provide APIs, webhooks and workflow automation primitives. Can we run custom code/actions (e.g., user provisioning, password reset) from flows?
11. Typical implementation timeline, required resources, and professional services offerings. Provide a sample pilot plan and milestones.
12. Pricing model and cost components (license, per‑user, per‑concurrent, per-resolution, token/usage fees, implementation).
13. Monitoring & governance features: audit logs, conversation transcripts, model change controls, analytics dashboards.
14. Provide customer references (especially US enterprises using ServiceNow/Teams) and case studies with measurable outcomes.
15. Support SLAs, escalation paths and managed vs self‑managed options.

## Integration checklist (must-haves for IT deployments)
- SSO integration (SAML/OIDC/Azure AD) and SCIM user provisioning
- ServiceNow (or primary ITSM) bi‑directional ticket sync (incident/request/changes)
- CMDB mapping / context enrichment for users, devices, services
- Collaboration platform connectors (Slack, MS Teams) with bot users & message threading
- Email connectors for send/receive and ticket creation
- Portal embedding / web chat widget and mobile SDK support
- Secure action connectors (password reset, account unlock, provisioning) with privileged credentials vault
- APIs/webhooks for orchestration and custom actions
- Logging & audit exports to SIEM (Splunk/Elastic) and data retention controls
- Consent/data-use flags and opt‑out for model training
- Support for multi‑tenancy or multi‑domain accounts if applicable

---

## Pricing model considerations
- Common pricing components:
  - Platform subscription (per month / per tenant)
  - Seats vs concurrent users vs requests/resolutions
  - Add‑ons: premium connectors, on‑prem deployment, security/compliance options
  - Implementation / professional services
  - Usage-based LLM/token fees or premium model access
  - Support tiers (standard/premium/enterprise)
- Ask vendors to provide TCO examples for pilot scale (e.g., 5k employees) and production scale (50k+ employees).

---

## Pilot plan (suggested)
Goals: Validate integration with ITSM, measure automation rate, test core use cases (password reset, software requests, basic incident triage), evaluate governance and UX.

Timeline: 8–12 weeks
- Week 0: Kickoff, success metrics, legal/security onboarding
- Weeks 1–2: Integration setup (SSO, ServiceNow sandbox connector, Slack/Teams)
- Weeks 3–5: Build 3–5 prioritized flows (password reset, account unlock, software install, common incidents)
- Weeks 6–7: User testing (alpha with IT agents, beta with subset of employees)
- Week 8: Measure automation rate, escalation behavior, feedback; decision on production rollout
Deliverables: Integration checklist completed, automation metrics report, user satisfaction score, security signoffs.

Success metrics to measure:
- % of requests resolved without agent handoff
- Reduction in queue/backlog for Tier 1
- Average handling time reduction
- Employee satisfaction (CSAT)
- False escalations / incorrect actions rate

---

## Suggested scoring rubric (example)
- Integration depth (1–5) — weight 20%
- Automation outcomes (1–5) — weight 25%
- Security & compliance (1–5) — weight 15%
- Channel & UX (1–5) — weight 10%
- LLM governance & data controls (1–5) — weight 15%
- TCO & licensing fit (1–5) — weight 15%

---

## Next steps (recommended)
1. Shortlist top 3 vendors from the recommended shortlist (suggested: Moveworks, Aisera, ServiceNow or Microsoft depending on primary ITSM/M365 posture).
2. Issue a targeted RFI/RFP using the questions above; request demo focused on 3 prioritized workflows and integration with your ServiceNow (or primary ITSM) sandbox.
3. Run 8–12 week pilot with at least one production channel (Teams or Slack) and measure against the success metrics.
4. Validate security/compliance artifacts and request SOC2/ISO attestation plus data handling commitments.
5. Negotiate commercial terms including implementation scope, support SLAs, and predictable pricing for scaling.
